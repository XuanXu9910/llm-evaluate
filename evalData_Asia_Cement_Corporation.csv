The ESG report prepared by Asia Cement adheres to several internationally recognized frameworks, primarily the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). These frameworks are designed to enhance transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting, allowing organizations to effectively communicate their environmental, social, and governance impacts.

### Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

Asia Cement aligns its sustainability reporting with the GRI standards, which provide a comprehensive framework for organizations to disclose their economic, environmental, and social impacts. The GRI standards are widely recognized and utilized by various entities, including Asia Cement and ACC, to ensure their reports meet rigorous criteria for transparency and accountability [Data: Entities (4, 23); Relationships (3, 66, 1377, 1235, 1418)]. The GRI Content Index is also employed by Asia Cement to structure its sustainability disclosures, ensuring comprehensive reporting of its sustainability practices [Data: Relationships (1067)].

### Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)

In addition to GRI, Asia Cement adheres to the SASB standards, which focus on sustainability accounting across various industries, including the building materials sector. This alignment ensures that Asia Cement's disclosures are consistent with industry benchmarks, promoting accountability in its sustainability practices [Data: Entities (3, 31); Relationships (2, 1230)]. The SASB framework is recognized for its emphasis on material, decision-useful information for investors, further enhancing the credibility of Asia Cement's ESG report.

### Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Asia Cement actively incorporates the TCFD recommendations into its reporting practices, particularly in relation to climate change management. The TCFD framework aims to improve transparency regarding climate-related risks and opportunities, which is crucial for stakeholders seeking to understand a company's commitment to low-carbon transformation [Data: Entities (30); Relationships (40)]. By following TCFD guidelines, Asia Cement demonstrates its dedication to addressing climate-related challenges and enhancing its sustainability efforts.

## Alignment with Frameworks

The alignment of Asia Cement's ESG report with these frameworks is robust. The company utilizes the GRI standards for its sustainability reporting, ensuring that its disclosures effectively communicate its sustainability impacts [Data: Relationships (3, 66, 1377)]. Furthermore, the integration of SASB and TCFD standards into its reporting practices enhances the report's credibility and relevance to stakeholders, including investors and regulatory bodies [Data: Relationships (2, 40)].

     - It highlights cumulative carbon emissions reductions of **over 350,000 tons** from 2011 to 2023, equivalent to the carbon absorption of 889 Da’an Forest Parks in one year.
   - **Energy Efficiency**:
     - Energy consumption metrics, such as the reduction in energy use per ton of cementitious materials, are compared against both the **2017 baseline** and intermediate targets for **2023** and **2030**.
   - **Circular Economy**:
     - Data on the use of **alternative fuels and raw materials** are tracked year-on-year, with a noticeable increase in adoption rates over the reporting period.

---

### Use of Visuals and Metrics

- **Graphs and Tables**:

   - Comparisons are often presented against **baseline years** (e.g., 2017, 2021) to show cumulative and annual progress.

- **Clear Metrics**:
   - Quantitative metrics, such as percentage reductions, tonnage of recycled materials, and renewable energy contributions, are prominently displayed to provide clarity and transparency.

---

### Transparency and Meaningfulness

1. **Clarity of Comparisons**:
   - The report clearly identifies baseline years and the methodology for tracking progress. For example, reductions in emissions are aligned with **Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)** pathways, ensuring comparability.

2. **Third-Party Assurance**:
   - Performance data are verified by **SGS Taiwan Ltd.**, adding credibility and transparency to the historical comparisons.

3. **Alignment with Goals**:
   - Progress is explicitly linked to the company's **short-term (2025)**, **mid-term (2030)**, and **long-term (2050)** sustainability goals. This makes the comparisons meaningful by showing how current performance aligns with strategic objectives.

---

### Areas for Improvement

While the comparisons are generally strong, a few areas could enhance their effectiveness:
1. **Consistency Across ESG Dimensions**:
   - While environmental and governance data are well-documented, some **social metrics** (e.g., diversity and inclusion, community impact) could include more detailed year-on-year comparisons.
2. **Benchmarking Against Peers**:
   - Comparisons with industry averages or competitors could further contextualize ACC's performance.
