The reports indicate that Uni-President is actively engaged in monitoring and managing its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance, particularly focusing on greenhouse gas emissions and sustainability initiatives. However, the extent to which current ESG performance data is compared with historical data to highlight progress or trends over time is somewhat limited.

### Current Performance Metrics

Uni-President has reported a total of 1,596,404 metric tons CO2e in greenhouse gas emissions for 2022, which slightly decreased to 1,567,139 metric tons CO2e in 2023. This data reflects a commitment to reducing emissions and showcases a trend towards improved sustainability practices [Data: Reports (354)]. Additionally, specific sustainability initiatives, such as the Water Chiller Building Energy Saving Project, have led to significant reductions in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, with a reported reduction of 2,470 GJ of energy consumption and 349.56 tons of CO2 emissions in 2023 [Data: Reports (32)].

### Limitations in Historical Comparisons

Despite these positive indicators, the reports do not provide explicit historical comparisons of ESG performance data. While there is a general acknowledgment of the importance of transparency and accountability in sustainability practices, the lack of detailed historical data limits the ability to assess whether the comparisons made are meaningful or transparent [Data: Reports (300, 419)]. Furthermore, while compliance with sustainability reporting mandates from the Taiwan Stock Exchange is noted, there is no specific mention of how current ESG performance data is juxtaposed with historical data to illustrate trends over time [Data: Reports (390, 248, 455)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while Uni-President demonstrates a commitment to tracking and improving its ESG performance, the reports do not sufficiently compare current data with historical data to highlight progress or trends effectively. The absence of explicit historical comparisons raises questions about the meaningfulness and transparency of the reported ESG performance metrics. Therefore, stakeholders may find it challenging to fully assess the company's progress in sustainability initiatives without clearer historical context [Data: Reports (428, 232, 300)].","#### **Comparison of ESG Performance Data with Historical Data**
