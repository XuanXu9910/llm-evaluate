The **2023 ESG Sustainability Report** published by San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. does not explicitly mention the comparison of current ESG performance data with historical data. The report primarily focuses on detailing the company's current initiatives, performance, and commitments related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. It highlights various sustainability initiatives, such as carbon emissions reduction, energy conservation, and waste management, but does not provide a historical context or trend analysis to illustrate progress over time [Data: Entities (72, 63); Relationships (738, 635)].

### Transparency and Meaningfulness of Comparisons

While the report emphasizes transparency in its sustainability efforts and governance practices, the lack of historical data comparisons may limit the meaningfulness of the insights provided. Effective ESG reporting typically includes trend analysis to help stakeholders understand how a company's performance evolves over time, which can enhance accountability and inform decision-making. The absence of such comparisons in the current report suggests that stakeholders may not have a complete view of the company's progress or the effectiveness of its sustainability strategies [Data: Entities (1262, 316); Relationships (1068, 1069)].

### Conclusion

In summary, the **2023 ESG Sustainability Report** does not provide a comparative analysis of current ESG performance against historical data, which could have added depth to the understanding of the company's sustainability journey. The report's focus on current initiatives and practices, while transparent, may not fully satisfy stakeholders looking for a comprehensive view of progress over time. This highlights an area for potential improvement in future reports to enhance the meaningfulness and transparency of ESG performance evaluations [Data: Entities (1260, 1263); Relationships (1067, 1066)].","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The ESG report for San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. provides certain historical data to highlight trends and measure progress over time. These comparisons, while meaningful in specific areas, vary in depth and transparency across the report's sections.

---

#### **Environmental Performance**

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:**
   - The report discusses the company's efforts to reduce GHG emissions through process improvements and energy conservation measures. However, it does not provide detailed year-over-year comparisons of absolute or intensity-based GHG emissions to clearly illustrate trends or progress.

2. **Energy Management:**
   - While energy conservation and the adoption of renewable energy are central to the company’s environmental initiatives, quantitative comparisons of energy consumption across years are not comprehensively detailed, limiting transparency in this area.

3. **Waste Management:**
   - The company outlines its waste reduction initiatives and discusses the environmental benefits achieved. However, historical data comparing waste generated and managed across years is not provided, reducing the ability to evaluate long-term performance.

---

#### **Social Performance**

1. **Employee Satisfaction and Training:**
   - The report includes data on employee satisfaction surveys, showing a 71.6% average satisfaction rate in 2023. While this snapshot is valuable, the absence of comparisons to previous years limits insight into whether employee sentiment has improved over time.
   - Training hours are detailed (27,563.7 hours in 2023), but historical data is not provided to contextualize this achievement.

2. **Occupational Health and Safety:**
   - The report emphasizes improvements in workplace safety but does not include historical metrics (e.g., incident rates or lost-time injury rates) to illustrate trends or the effectiveness of safety initiatives.

---

#### **Governance and Economic Performance**

1. **Financial Metrics:**
   - Historical comparisons are available for certain financial indicators, such as net operating revenue and after-tax net income. For example:
     - Net operating revenue decreased slightly from NT$10,763,499 in 2022 to NT$10,086,736 in 2023.
     - After-tax net income grew significantly from NT$470,114 in 2022 to NT$760,274 in 2023.
   - These financial comparisons provide a clear view of trends and contribute to understanding the economic sustainability of the business.

2. **Corporate Governance Metrics:**
   - The report discusses the operation of the board of directors, including meeting attendance rates and committee activities for 2023. However, there are no historical benchmarks for governance performance, which would enhance transparency.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Historical financial comparisons are included, offering insights into the company’s economic performance trends.
   - The report provides a narrative on year-over-year progress in key focus areas, such as environmental sustainability and employee satisfaction.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Include consistent historical data for environmental metrics (e.g., GHG emissions, energy usage, waste generation) to allow stakeholders to evaluate performance trends.
   - Provide year-over-year data for social indicators, such as employee satisfaction, training hours, and safety metrics, to demonstrate long-term progress.

The ESG report for San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. provides a narrative on the company’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and addressing climate change. However, the report does not offer detailed, quantifiable data on carbon emissions segmented by Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 categories.

---

#### **Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 Emissions**

1. **Scope 1 (Direct Emissions):**
   - The report mentions efforts to reduce GHG emissions through operational improvements and energy conservation but does not present specific numerical data for Scope 1 emissions.

2. **Scope 2 (Indirect Emissions from Energy):**
   - The report highlights the company's adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as part of its sustainability strategy. However, it does not include quantitative Scope 2 emission figures or details about electricity usage and associated emissions.

3. **Scope 3 (Value Chain Emissions):**
   - While the report references supply chain sustainability and collaboration with suppliers to promote environmentally friendly practices, it does not quantify Scope 3 emissions from the supply chain, product lifecycle, or other indirect sources.

---

#### **Third-Party Verification**

The report does not specify whether its GHG emissions data, or the lack thereof, have been verified by an independent third party. Verification is a critical component for ensuring the credibility and reliability of disclosed emissions data, which is currently absent from the report.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The report outlines the company’s commitment to climate action, including initiatives such as process improvements, energy conservation, and supplier engagement.
   - It highlights alignment with global standards, such as the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which demonstrates a forward-looking approach to emissions reduction.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Include detailed, quantifiable data on Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, supported by comprehensive methodologies for emissions calculation.
   - Seek third-party verification for the emissions data to enhance transparency and stakeholder confidence.
   - Provide year-over-year comparisons of emissions data to illustrate progress toward reduction goals.

---

#### **Conclusion**

While the ESG report for San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. emphasizes the company’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, it lacks the quantifiable emissions data necessary for a robust evaluation of its performance in this area.

The ESG report for San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. discusses the company’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of its sustainability initiatives. While the report mentions the alignment of its reduction efforts with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), it does not provide comprehensive details regarding specific targets, milestones, or deadlines for tracking progress.

---

#### **Science-Based Targets**

The report highlights the company’s commitment to signing the SBTi initiative, indicating its intention to align its emission reduction goals with scientifically validated pathways to limit global warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C. This alignment demonstrates the company’s awareness of the importance of setting rigorous and credible targets. However, the following gaps were noted:

1. **Specific Targets:**
   - The report does not specify concrete emission reduction percentages or absolute targets for Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 emissions.

2. **Time-Bound Goals:**
   - While there is a mention of long-term sustainability efforts, the report does not provide clear deadlines or intermediate milestones for achieving these emission reduction goals.

3. **Detailed Strategy:**
   - The report lacks a breakdown of the actions or measures planned to meet these targets, such as renewable energy adoption, process improvements, or supply chain optimization.

---

#### **Milestones and Deadlines**

The absence of clearly defined milestones and deadlines is a notable gap. Effective tracking of progress requires time-bound objectives that enable stakeholders to assess whether the company is on track to meet its commitments. For example, companies adhering to SBTi typically outline multi-year reduction targets, such as achieving a 30% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The company demonstrates awareness of global standards by referencing its intention to align with the SBTi framework.
   - The report acknowledges the need for collaboration with suppliers and stakeholders to drive emissions reductions across the value chain.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Define specific, quantifiable emission reduction targets aligned with SBTi guidelines.
   - Include intermediate milestones and deadlines to enable progress tracking.
   - Provide a detailed strategy or roadmap outlining the measures and resources dedicated to achieving these targets.

---

#### **Conclusion**

While San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.’s ESG report reflects its commitment to science-based emission reduction frameworks such as SBTi, the lack of specific, measurable targets and time-bound milestones limits the transparency and accountability of its goals.

### Training and Awareness Programs

To further promote diversity and inclusion, the Company provides training and education on integrity policies and ethical behavior to all employees. This training is designed to enhance awareness of diversity issues and foster a respectful workplace culture [Data: Entities (120, 1127); Relationships (466, 463)].

---

#### **Diversity and Inclusion Policies**

This gender imbalance is attributed to the nature of the industry. Although the report provides this breakdown, there is no mention of specific initiatives aimed at improving gender diversity.

The company has established a framework of anti-corruption policies and procedures that are integral to its operations. These include **anti-corruption regulations** and **anti-corruption clauses** that prohibit bribery and unethical behavior. The **anti-corruption regulations** are laws and guidelines that the company complies with to prevent corruption and bribery in its operations [Data: Entities (452); Entities (414)]. 

Additionally, the company conducts **compliance audits** annually to ensure adherence to these laws and regulations, which serves as a mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of its anti-corruption measures [Data: Entities (444); Relationships (230)]. The **compliance system** is also a critical component of the company's operations, aimed at managing risks and upholding its reputation [Data: Relationships (685)].

## Evidence of Implementation

While the reports do outline the existence of these anti-corruption policies, there is limited information regarding specific cases addressed or outcomes achieved. The **2023 ESG Sustainability Report** and the **ESG Report** detail the company's performance and initiatives related to environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and governance, but they do not explicitly provide examples of anti-corruption cases or the results of implemented policies [Data: Entities (123); Entities (401); Relationships (654); Relationships (755)].

The **Sustainability Reporting** process is designed to communicate the company's sustainability efforts and impacts to stakeholders, which may include information on anti-corruption initiatives. However, the specifics regarding cases or outcomes related to anti-corruption are not detailed in the available data [Data: Entities (1262); Relationships (431)].

In summary, while the company has established anti-corruption policies and conducts audits to ensure compliance, the reports do not provide explicit evidence of implementation through documented cases or outcomes achieved. Further transparency in reporting could enhance stakeholder understanding of the effectiveness of these measures.","#### **Anti-Corruption Policies and Implementation**
