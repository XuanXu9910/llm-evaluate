These frameworks are well-established in the field of sustainability reporting and provide guidelines for companies to disclose their environmental, social, and governance performance transparently and comprehensively.

The report explicitly states that it has been prepared based on the GRI Universal Standards 2021, indicating a commitment to follow established guidelines for sustainability disclosures. The GRI framework focuses on the impact of an organization on the environment, society, and the economy, which aligns with AGV's objective to disclose its sustainability practices and performance. Additionally, the report includes a reference to SASB standards, which are tailored to various industries and emphasize the disclosure of financially material sustainability information, thereby catering to the interests of investors and stakeholders.

Moreover, the report incorporates elements of the TCFD recommendations, particularly concerning climate-related risks and opportunities. It discusses how the governance structure manages climate-related risks and integrates them into the overall risk management system. This alignment demonstrates AGV's awareness of the growing importance of climate change in corporate strategy and risk management.

AGV's sustainability report not only references these frameworks but also indicates a structured approach toward stakeholder engagement, materiality assessment, and performance management. The systematic identification of six material topics—such as economic performance, emissions, and food safety—suggests that the company is prioritizing significant sustainability issues relevant to its operations and stakeholders, which is a core element of the GRI and SASB frameworks.

In summary, AGV Products Corporation's ESG report is well-aligned with internationally recognized frameworks like GRI, SASB, and TCFD, reflecting a comprehensive and strategic approach to sustainability reporting that addresses the concerns of various stakeholders while promoting transparency and accountability in its operations.","#### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The report covers the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023, and explicitly states that the data and content disclosed primarily pertain to this time frame. 

In terms of organizational scope, the report includes AGV’s headquarters but excludes certain subsidiaries. Specifically, it does not cover non-TWSE (Taiwan Stock Exchange) or TPEx (Taipei Exchange) listed subsidiaries, subsidiaries established solely for investment or tax purposes, and those subsidiaries over which AGV has no operational control. This delineation ensures that stakeholders understand which parts of the company are included in the report, providing transparency regarding the scope of the sustainability practices and performance being reported. 

Overall, the report adheres to the ""Rules Governing the Preparation and Filing of Sustainability Reports by TWSE Listed Companies,"" which emphasizes the importance of clear and accurate reporting boundaries.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The ESG report of AGV Products Corporation clearly defines its organizational scope and time frame, adhering to standard disclosure practices to ensure transparency and stakeholder clarity. 

---

#### **Time Frame**

The report encompasses the reporting period of January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. This is explicitly stated in the ""Boundaries and Scope of Reporting"" section, ensuring readers understand the temporal context of the data and disclosures. The report also highlights that it is issued annually, with the current edition released in August 2024. This regularity underscores AGV’s commitment to consistent sustainability reporting.

---

#### **Organizational Scope**

The report specifies that its content focuses on AGV’s headquarters, excluding:

1. **Non-TWSE/TPEx-Listed Subsidiaries:** These subsidiaries are excluded due to their lack of operational control by AGV.
2. **Investment or Tax Purposes Subsidiaries:** Entities established solely for investment or tax-related purposes are outside the report’s scope.
3. **Subsidiaries Without Operational Control:** Entities over which AGV does not have direct operational oversight are also excluded.

The scope of the report aligns with AGV’s annual report for the same time period (January 1 to December 31, 2023), ensuring consistency in financial and non-financial disclosures.

---

#### **Clarity in Reporting Boundaries**

To provide further transparency, the report adheres to the GRI materiality principle, using stringent standards for data collection and verification. Additionally, any instances where data or scope deviate from the annual report are explicitly stated within the ESG report, minimizing ambiguity.

---

#### **Strengths in Defining Scope**

1. **Consistency:** The report aligns its scope with AGV’s annual financial reporting, ensuring stakeholders can easily correlate ESG and financial data.
2. **Transparency:** Clear exclusions (e.g., subsidiaries established for investment purposes) are documented, preventing potential misinterpretations.
3. **Verification:** The inclusion of third-party assurance from Crowe Taiwan enhances the credibility of the scope and boundaries defined in the report.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Supply Chain Inclusion:** While the report provides insights into supplier management, it could further detail how the ESG performance of the supply chain is integrated into the broader organizational scope.
2. **Subsidiary Reporting:** Including at least an overview or high-level performance summary of excluded subsidiaries would offer a more comprehensive picture.

---

AGV’s ESG report demonstrates a well-defined organizational scope and reporting time frame, adhering to recognized standards. These clear boundaries reinforce the reliability and comprehensiveness of the disclosures, although additional insights into excluded areas and the supply chain could further enhance stakeholder understanding.",0.75,0.2222222219753086,0.6273892270552813,0.9166666666666666,0.59,0.8067723437393965

AGV recognizes that economic performance is fundamental to its corporate operations and serves as a pillar for sustainable growth. The sustainability strategies are designed not only to meet stakeholder expectations but also to create a virtuous cycle where economic, environmental, and social dimensions enhance one another.

AGV has identified six material topics—economic performance, procurement practices, water resource management, emissions, occupational safety and health, and food safety—that are integral to its business strategy. Each of these topics is linked to specific goals and targets, such as revenue growth, profit increase, and compliance with environmental regulations. By prioritizing these areas, AGV aims to create value not only for the company but also for its stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the communities in which it operates. The mention of a Sustainable Development Task Force further emphasizes the structured approach AGV has adopted for monitoring and implementing its ESG commitments.

The connections between ESG initiatives and business strategy are articulated through various mechanisms in the report. For instance, the company conducts regular assessments of its performance against these material topics and adjusts its strategies accordingly. The report indicates that AGV’s management holds frequent meetings to track performance and adapt to changing market conditions, thereby ensuring that sustainability remains a dynamic component of its business strategy. Additionally, AGV's commitment to compliance with legal standards and stakeholder engagement reinforces the actionable nature of its ESG strategies.

In summary, AGV effectively links its ESG initiatives to its overall business strategy by clearly identifying material topics, setting measurable goals, and maintaining an adaptive management approach. The connections are not only articulated but are also embedded in the company's operational practices, making them actionable and aligned with long-term business objectives.","#### **Linkage Between ESG Initiatives and Business Strategy**

AGV’s overarching business strategy is built around the philosophy of ""For a Healthy Tomorrow,"" which emphasizes health, sustainability, and corporate social responsibility. This vision directly aligns with the company’s ESG initiatives:

1. **Core Principles:**
   - The “Three No, Three Less, and Three Lots of” policy integrates product quality, health benefits, and environmental sustainability into the company’s operational strategy.

#### **Integration into Strategic Goals**

The report explicitly links key ESG initiatives to actionable business strategies:

1. **Climate Change Adaptation:**
   - AGV’s focus on energy management, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, and waste management reflects its alignment with global climate goals. For instance, the adoption of renewable energy sources and the implementation of wastewater recycling are directly tied to cost savings and operational efficiency, which strengthen its competitive advantage.

2. **Food Safety and Quality:**
   - The emphasis on advanced food safety management systems and certifications enhances consumer trust and aligns with AGV’s brand promise of delivering safe and healthy products. This directly contributes to the company’s market positioning and reputation.

4. **Supply Chain Management:**
   - The company’s focus on supplier sustainability ensures that raw materials are sourced responsibly, supporting both environmental and social sustainability while safeguarding the continuity of supply chains.

---

#### **Clear Articulation of Connections**

The report uses structured frameworks like GRI and TCFD to articulate how its ESG strategies support its overall business goals. For example:

1. **Materiality Assessment:**
   - The six material topics identified (e.g., procurement practices, economic performance, food safety) are mapped to specific business priorities, ensuring that ESG efforts target areas with significant strategic impact.

2. **Sustainability Goals and Metrics:**
   - Short-, medium-, and long-term ESG targets are outlined, such as reducing carbon emissions and increasing energy efficiency, which are actionable and measurable components of the business strategy.

3. **Governance and Oversight:**
   - The establishment of a Sustainable Development Organization and task forces ensures that ESG initiatives are systematically managed and aligned with corporate objectives.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Clear articulation of how ESG initiatives, such as climate adaptation and food safety, drive business value.
   - Integration of stakeholder priorities into strategic planning.
   - Use of measurable targets to track ESG performance and its business impact.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - Further detailing the financial impacts or cost-benefit analysis of ESG initiatives would enhance the understanding of their value to the overall business.
   - Expanding on how specific ESG goals align with broader global standards, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), could add depth to the report.

Specifically, it outlines the company's economic performance and sustainability topics, focusing on measurable indicators such as revenue growth and profit margins, along with ratios like Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Earnings Per Share (EPS). These metrics are compared year-over-year (YOY) to showcase trends and progress in the company's operations.

The report indicates that performance data exceeds average targets compared to peers in the food industry, and it emphasizes the importance of this economic performance as a foundational element for corporate operations and sustainability. The company's strategic goals for economic performance are aligned with its broader sustainability objectives, creating a virtuous cycle that supports continuous improvement. The reporting includes a systematic approach to tracking and adjusting strategies based on external conditions, further enhancing the transparency of performance measurement.

Moreover, the report adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, which emphasize materiality and transparency in sustainability reporting. By identifying six material topics—such as economic performance and food safety—the report provides stakeholders with insights into AGV's commitments and performance in critical areas. The management of economic performance is overseen by a Sustainable Development Task Force that ensures ongoing assessment and alignment with ESG goals. This governance structure adds an additional layer of transparency and accountability to the reporting process.

In summary, the AGV Products Corporation Sustainability Report does compare current ESG performance data with historical data, presenting meaningful insights into the company's progress over time. The commitment to transparency and adherence to recognized reporting standards further supports the credibility of the comparisons made in the report.","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance Data with Historical Data**

The ESG report of AGV Products Corporation provides a structured and transparent overview of its current ESG performance. While it adheres to recognized frameworks such as GRI and TCFD, the report also attempts to highlight progress by incorporating comparisons with historical data in select areas. However, the extent and clarity of these comparisons vary.

---

#### **Progress Highlighted Through Historical Data**

1. **Environmental Performance:**
   - The report includes data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption, and waste management. For instance, it outlines progress in carbon emission reduction efforts and energy efficiency projects. While specific numerical comparisons with previous years are mentioned, the report would benefit from more consistent trend visualization, such as multi-year graphs or tables.

2. **Economic Performance:**
   - Economic indicators, such as annual revenue and production volumes, are presented alongside historical benchmarks. This provides stakeholders with insight into the company’s financial stability and growth in relation to its ESG efforts.

3. **Employee Welfare and Social Engagement:**
   - AGV details its initiatives related to employee care, welfare, and career development, such as training hours and welfare benefits. While these are outlined in narrative form, historical data to quantitatively compare year-over-year improvements is less prominent.

---

#### **Strengths of Historical Comparisons**

1. **Transparency:**
   - The report discloses key performance metrics related to emissions and energy, aligning with TCFD and GRI standards. This provides stakeholders with a clear understanding of AGV’s environmental footprint and progress toward sustainability goals.

2. **Materiality and Relevance:**
   - By focusing on material issues such as GHG emissions and energy consumption, the report aligns historical data comparisons with stakeholder priorities.

---

#### **Limitations and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Limited Scope of Historical Data:**
   - While the report does compare some current data to previous periods, the scope is not comprehensive across all ESG dimensions. For example, metrics on water use, waste management, and social impact could benefit from multi-year comparisons.

2. **Lack of Trend Visualization:**
   - The report could enhance its transparency by including visual aids, such as charts or graphs, to represent trends over multiple years. This would make comparisons more intuitive and accessible to stakeholders.

3. **Benchmarking:**
   - The absence of comparisons with industry standards or peer performance makes it challenging to contextualize AGV’s progress relative to its competitors.

---

#### **Recommendations**

1. **Incorporate Multi-Year Trends:**
   - AGV should consider including at least three years of data for key ESG metrics to highlight trends more effectively.

2. **Enhance Visualization:**
   - Adding graphs and charts for historical comparisons would improve readability and stakeholder engagement.

3. **Broaden Historical Data Coverage:**
   - Expanding historical data across additional ESG areas, such as water resource management and employee training metrics, would provide a more comprehensive picture of progress.

4. **Introduce Industry Benchmarking:**
   - Including comparisons with industry averages or best practices would contextualize AGV’s ESG performance within the broader market.

---

#### **Conclusion**

The ESG report of AGV Products Corporation demonstrates a commitment to tracking and disclosing performance over time. While some areas, such as environmental and economic performance, include historical data comparisons, there is room for improvement in the scope and visualization of these comparisons. By expanding its historical data coverage and enhancing trend representation, AGV could further strengthen the transparency and meaningfulness of its ESG disclosures.",0.4444444444444444,0.0952380951927437,0.549538929915269,0.76,0.34,0.720258811100916

It indicates that the total energy consumption reached 364,413.06 GJ. Of this total, the consumption of purchased electricity was 39,220.97 GJ, which represents approximately 10.76% of their total energy usage. Importantly, the report explicitly states that AGV does not utilize renewable energy sources.

When examining the energy consumption trends over the past few years, there is a notable increase in electricity consumption. For instance, in 2021, the electricity consumption was recorded at 10,513,600 kWh, which rose to 10,788,451 kWh in 2022, and further increased to 10,894,715 kWh in 2023. This trend indicates a gradual rise in energy usage, although the overall total energy consumption slightly decreased from 400,015.40 GJ in 2022 to 364,413.06 GJ in 2023.

In terms of efficiency, the report also highlights the energy intensity metric, which is measured in GJ per thousand dozens produced. This figure decreased from 54.64 GJ/thousand dozens in 2022 to 49.63 GJ/thousand dozens in 2023, suggesting improvements in energy efficiency despite the increase in total electricity usage. 

Overall, while AGV shows a commitment to monitoring energy consumption and improving efficiency, the lack of renewable energy utilization and the overall increase in energy consumption raise potential concerns about sustainability practices going forward.","#### **Evaluation of Energy Usage and Efficiency**

Given that AGV produces water-intensive products such as fruit juices and canned goods, the management of water resources is deemed critical, especially considering the uneven distribution of water in Taiwan and the increased frequency of extreme weather events.

AGV outlines several key strategies and practices aimed at water conservation. The company has set a short-term goal to reduce water consumption by 3% by 2025, with a base year of 2023. In terms of actual water usage, the report states that AGV withdrew a total of 378.038 million liters (ML) of municipal water in 2023, which marks a reduction of 9.68% compared to previous years. The company also reported that it consumed 52.73 ML of water in the same year.

Additionally, the report details AGV's efforts to recycle water. In 2023, the company implemented a reclaimed water recycling system, which enabled the recovery and reuse of approximately 22,299 tonnes of wastewater for various purposes, such as cleaning and irrigation. This initiative significantly contributes to the reduction of overall water consumption.

To further enhance its water management practices, AGV holds regular meetings to discuss water-related issues, formulates policies to improve water usage in manufacturing processes, and conducts monthly performance reviews.

Primarily, AGV has established comprehensive human rights policies that align with internationally recognized standards, such as the International Bill of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This commitment is reflected in their adherence to the “Labor Standards Act” and the “Act of Gender Equality in Employment,” ensuring that all employees are treated with dignity and respect.

AGV conducts regular reviews and audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with labor rights, focusing on critical issues such as child labor, forced labor, sexual harassment, and freedom of expression. In 2023, 54 suppliers signed the “Social Responsibility Commitments for Suppliers,” committing to uphold ethical, environmental, and social responsibility in their production processes. Importantly, AGV reported that there were no incidents of forced labor among its suppliers, and they are prepared to initiate investigations and on-site evaluations if any violations are suspected.

To ensure fair labor practices, AGV has implemented a “Supplier Social Responsibility Audit Checklist” that evaluates suppliers on key areas such as labor and human rights, health and safety, environmental standards, and ethical practices. In 2023, AGV conducted on-site evaluations of 79 suppliers, accounting for approximately 34.8% of their total supplier base, with no unqualified suppliers reported. This system not only verifies compliance but also emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and improvement within the supply chain.

Furthermore, AGV provides a whistleblowing mechanism for employees and stakeholders to report any violations related to human rights and labor practices. This independent reporting channel ensures that concerns can be raised confidentially and appropriately addressed, reinforcing AGV's commitment to maintaining fair labor practices and protecting human rights throughout its operations. Overall, the combination of strong policies, regular audits, and open communication channels underpins AGV's commitment to safeguarding human rights and promoting ethical labor practices.","#### **Evaluation of Measures to Safeguard Human Rights**

   - The company organizes four annual awareness sessions on human rights policies to educate employees about their rights and responsibilities. The policies ensure compliance with labor laws and regulations while prohibiting child labor, forced labor, and workplace discrimination.

---

#### **Supply Chain Safeguards**

1. **Supplier Social Responsibility Commitments:**
   - AGV requires its suppliers to sign the **Social Responsibility Commitments for Suppliers**, which cover labor and human rights, health and safety, environmental protection, and ethical practices. In 2023, 54 primary raw material suppliers signed these commitments.

2. **Audits and Compliance Checks:**
   - The company uses a **Supplier Social Responsibility Audit Checklist** to monitor and evaluate supplier practices. On-site evaluations were conducted for 79 suppliers, representing 34.8% of the supplier base, with no unqualified suppliers identified. These audits help ensure that suppliers comply with labor standards, including the prohibition of forced and child labor.

3. **Preventive Measures:**
   - If a supplier is found engaging in unethical labor practices, AGV investigates the issue, communicates with management, and conducts an on-site re-evaluation to ensure compliance. Suppliers must address deficiencies promptly or risk disqualification.

---

#### **Whistleblowing and Reporting Mechanisms**

1. **Reporting Channels:**
   - AGV has established an independent reporting channel managed by dedicated personnel to address violations of human rights and ethical principles. This channel is accessible to employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders, ensuring transparency and accountability.

2. **Confidentiality Protections:**

2. **Proactive Audits:**
   - Regular supplier evaluations and audits ensure that human rights principles are upheld throughout the supply chain.

3. **Robust Reporting Systems:**
   - Whistleblowing channels provide an effective mechanism for addressing human rights violations, promoting accountability.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Broader Audit Coverage:**
   - While 34.8% of suppliers were evaluated in 2023, expanding the scope of audits to include a higher percentage of the supply chain would enhance oversight.

2. **Quantifiable Impact Metrics:**
   - Reporting measurable outcomes of human rights initiatives, such as the number of issues resolved through the whistleblowing system, would provide greater transparency.

3. **Enhanced Training Programs:**
   - Incorporating human rights training for all employees and contractors, including security personnel, would strengthen awareness and compliance.

---

#### **Recommendations**

1. **Increase Audit Frequency and Scope:**
   - Conduct on-site evaluations for a larger proportion of suppliers and include follow-up audits to ensure sustained compliance.

2. **Publish Detailed Metrics:**
   - Share quantitative data on human rights violations reported and resolved to demonstrate the effectiveness of AGV’s initiatives.

3. **Expand Training Efforts:**
   - Develop mandatory human rights training programs for all employees and supply chain partners to reinforce AGV’s commitment to ethical practices.

---

#### **Conclusion**

AGV Products Corporation demonstrates a strong commitment to safeguarding human rights through comprehensive policies, supply chain audits, and robust reporting mechanisms. By expanding audit coverage, enhancing training programs, and providing detailed performance metrics, AGV can further strengthen its human rights management practices and set a benchmark for corporate responsibility.",1.0,0.2499999997916666,0.7044075501378053,1.0,0.71,0.8231148049560708

It specifies that the company has identified six material topics relevant to its sustainability efforts, which include economic performance, procurement practices, water resource management, emissions, occupational safety and health, and food safety. Each of these topics is a focus area for AGV's strategic commitments and future plans.

The goals set by AGV are structured to be both specific and measurable. For instance, the report mentions short-term goals such as a reduction in water consumption by 3% by 2025, and it emphasizes the importance of ongoing monitoring and management of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The company plans to conduct a comprehensive inventory of its carbon emissions in 2024, which will guide the development of actionable reduction strategies. Furthermore, AGV aims to implement an energy management system (ISO 50001) by 2025 to track and improve its energy performance.

In terms of detailed strategies, the report elaborates on various policies and practices. For example, AGV has committed to innovative development and performance management as part of its execution strategy for economic performance. The sustainability report also indicates that the Sustainable Development Task Force oversees the implementation of these strategies, ensuring they align with stakeholder expectations and regulatory requirements.

Overall, AGV's approach to achieving its ESG goals is backed by measurable targets, systematic strategies, and a governance structure that supports accountability and continuous improvement. The company aims to respond to external challenges and adapt its strategies based on performance evaluations and stakeholder engagement, thereby reinforcing its commitment to sustainability.","#### **Evaluation of Future ESG Goals and Strategies**
