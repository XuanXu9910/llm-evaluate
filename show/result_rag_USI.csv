The report specifies that it covers USI Corporation, including its Taipei headquarters, Guishan R&D Division, Kaohsiung Plant, and the USI Education Foundation. However, it notes that other subsidiaries presented in the consolidated financial statements are not included in this report. 

The time frame for the report is also specified, covering the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. This clarity ensures that stakeholders understand the specific parts of the company being reported on and the relevant timeframe for the data and information presented. The reporting also emphasizes that environmental performance data is primarily based on the Kaohsiung Plant, while other related information is disclosed separately, further delineating the scope of the report.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the ESG Report**

The USI 2023 ESG Report provides a clear definition of its organizational scope and reporting time frame, ensuring transparency and alignment with recognized sustainability reporting practices.

---

**Organizational Scope**

The report explicitly outlines the entities and operations included within its boundaries. It primarily covers the performance and management of USI Corporation, focusing on specific locations and activities:
1. **Included Entities:**
   - The report encompasses **USI Corporation's headquarters in Taipei**, the **Guishan R&D Division**, and the **Kaohsiung Plant**.
   - Specific environmental performance metrics are based on data from the **Kaohsiung Plant**, with other information disclosed separately in the report.

2. **Excluded Entities:**
   - Subsidiaries consolidated in financial statements are not included within the reporting boundary. This exclusion is explicitly stated, highlighting the report's focus on USI Corporation’s core operations.

3. **Supply Chain Considerations:**
   - While the report does not include detailed performance data from suppliers or extended supply chains, it addresses supplier-related sustainability efforts. For example, the **Supplier ESG Commitment** initiative and collaboration on the **Supply Chain Low-carbon Transition Coaching Program** are included.

---

**Time Frame**

The report specifies the reporting period as **January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023**, providing a one-year snapshot of the company’s ESG performance. This temporal scope is consistent throughout the report, ensuring clarity for stakeholders.

1. **Historical and Future Context:**
   - The report references prior initiatives and achievements (e.g., carbon reduction efforts since 2015) and future targets (e.g., carbon neutrality by 2050), linking current performance with long-term goals.

2. **Verification Timeline:**
   - The report includes assurance processes conducted during the reporting year, confirming that the disclosed data is consistent with the defined time frame.

---

#### **Strengths**

1. **Clarity in Scope:** The inclusion of specific sites and the exclusion of subsidiaries are clearly defined, preventing ambiguity about the report's boundaries.
2. **Time Frame Consistency:** The reporting period is explicitly stated and maintained throughout the document.
3. **Alignment with Standards:** The scope aligns with the requirements of the **GRI Standards: 2021**, which emphasize defining reporting boundaries.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Subsidiary Data Inclusion:** While the report excludes subsidiaries, incorporating performance highlights or sustainability metrics from significant subsidiaries could provide a more holistic view of the group’s overall ESG performance.
2. **Supply Chain Depth:** Including quantitative data or specific examples from the supply chain (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions or resource use reductions) would enhance the report’s coverage.

---

In conclusion, the USI 2023 ESG Report effectively defines its organizational scope and reporting time frame. It ensures stakeholders have a clear understanding of what is included and excluded, as well as the temporal boundaries of the disclosed data. Expanding the scope to include subsidiaries and supply chain metrics could further enhance the report's comprehensiveness.",1.0,0.4166666663194444,0.5840259329032906,1.0,0.59,0.7644203069606494

The report articulates a vision centered on ""creating sustainable value for a sustainable society,"" which underscores the integration of ESG considerations into the company’s core operations and strategic goals.

One of the key components of this linkage is found in the sustainability visions and goals outlined in Chapter 1 of the report. USI has developed three core strategies: ""R&D and innovation,"" ""steady operations,"" and ""social inclusion."" These strategies aim to create value collaboratively with stakeholders, reflecting a proactive approach to embedding sustainability into the business model. The emphasis on continuous improvement and innovation aligns with the company's operational performance, demonstrating that ESG initiatives are not isolated but rather intertwined with the company's broader objectives.

Moreover, the report discusses the role of the ESG Committee, which is supervised by the Board and is responsible for overseeing climate change management and other ESG-related activities. This governance structure ensures that ESG strategies are monitored and reported back to the Board regularly, making the initiatives actionable and accountable. The company conducts surveys and assessments to identify climate-related risks and opportunities, thereby integrating ESG considerations into its risk management processes, which are also linked to financial performance and operational strategies.

USI’s commitment to climate action is articulated through specific targets, such as the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 27% by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. These actionable targets illustrate the company's intention to not only address ESG factors but also to align them with measurable business outcomes. The report further outlines mechanisms for stakeholder engagement, ensuring that the concerns and expectations of various groups are considered in decision-making processes, reinforcing the connection between ESG initiatives and the company’s strategic direction.

In conclusion, the USI 2023 ESG Report articulates a coherent strategy that links ESG initiatives to the company's overall business objectives. The connections are not only clear but also actionable, as demonstrated by the governance structures, specific targets, and engagement processes that have been established. This comprehensive approach indicates a commitment to integrating sustainability deeply into the fabric of the business, paving the way for long-term value creation.","#### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

The USI 2023 ESG Report effectively connects the company’s ESG initiatives to its overarching business strategy. These linkages are presented clearly and align with the company's long-term vision of achieving sustainable growth and operational excellence.

---

### **Integration of ESG into Business Strategy**

1. **Core Strategic Alignment:**
   - USI’s vision to ""create and cohere sustainable value for a sustainable society"" underpins its ESG efforts. This vision is operationalized through three core strategies:
     - **R&D and Innovation:** The development of high-value and sustainable products to enhance market competitiveness.
     - **Steady Operations:** Ensuring financial stability and operational efficiency.
     - **Social Inclusion:** Promoting diversity, employee well-being, and community engagement.
   - These strategies reflect a deliberate alignment between sustainability objectives and the company’s business goals.

2. **Material Topics Integration:**
   - The ESG initiatives are organized around **11 material topics**, identified through a robust materiality analysis. These topics include **economic performance, climate change management, supply chain management, occupational safety and health, and talent retention**, ensuring that ESG considerations are embedded across key business functions.

---

### **Examples of Clear Articulation**

1. **Climate and Energy Management:**
   - USI’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050 and interim carbon reduction targets (e.g., 27% reduction by 2030) demonstrate a clear link between environmental responsibility and operational strategy. Initiatives such as increasing solar PV installations (targeting 20 MW capacity by 2027) and reducing greenhouse gas emissions align directly with global decarbonization trends.

2. **Innovation and Product Development:**
   - The High-Value R&D Center plays a critical role in developing sustainable materials, such as the ViviOn™ cyclic block copolymer, aligning product innovation with market demand for eco-friendly solutions. This supports the company's strategic focus on diversifying its product portfolio to achieve both financial and environmental goals.

3. **Supply Chain Low-Carbon Transition:**
   - Collaboration with customers and suppliers to achieve a shared carbon reduction target of 10,000 tons by 2025 highlights the company’s commitment to creating value across its value chain. This initiative aligns with its broader goal of establishing a green supply chain, directly linking ESG efforts to operational strategy.

4. **Employee Development and Social Inclusion:**
   - USI’s focus on talent retention and workplace safety reflects its commitment to social inclusion as a core strategy. Initiatives such as comprehensive employee training programs (e.g., 28,611 hours of ESH training in 2023) and industry-leading low turnover rates (4.4%) demonstrate actionable connections to its workforce sustainability goals.

---

### **Actionability of ESG Initiatives**

1. **Clear Targets and Metrics:**
   - USI sets quantifiable goals for key ESG initiatives, such as annual electricity and water conservation rates (e.g., 1% electricity reduction annually). These metrics are actionable and regularly tracked, ensuring accountability.

2. **Governance and Oversight:**
   - The inclusion of ESG performance in the Board's assessment processes demonstrates strong governance. This ensures that ESG initiatives are prioritized and linked to the company's decision-making framework.

3. **Five-Year Business Plan:**
   - USI integrates ESG objectives into its five-year business strategy, with specific short-, medium-, and long-term plans. For instance, promoting the circular economy and investing in downstream developments of the Gulei Project are linked to the company’s broader growth objectives.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
1. Well-defined connections between ESG initiatives and business strategy, ensuring alignment with long-term corporate goals.
2. Clear and measurable targets for environmental and social initiatives.
3. Strong governance mechanisms to ensure accountability and integration of ESG into decision-making.

**Improvement Areas:**
1. **Enhanced Communication:** While the report links ESG efforts to business strategy, it could provide more granular insights into how specific ESG outcomes drive financial performance.
2. **Expansion of Scope:** Including more detailed impacts of ESG initiatives on the broader value chain (e.g., downstream and upstream effects) could strengthen the narrative.

---

In conclusion, the USI 2023 ESG Report effectively demonstrates how ESG initiatives are deeply embedded in the company’s overall business strategy. The connections are actionable and supported by clear goals and metrics, ensuring that sustainability is both a priority and a driver of long-term success. Further emphasis on financial impacts and value chain integration would enhance the comprehensiveness of the report.",1.0,0.0869565217013232,0.7813074921865546,1.0,0.6,0.8517326711561111

The USI 2023 ESG Report provides detailed, quantifiable data on the company’s carbon emissions, including Scope 1, Scope 2, and partial Scope 3 emissions. These disclosures demonstrate a robust commitment to transparency and align with internationally recognized frameworks. The metrics are also subject to third-party verification, enhancing their credibility.

---

### **Quantifiable Carbon Emissions Data**

1. **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions:**
   - The report states that **total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions amounted to 142,292 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)** in 2023. This includes:
     - **Scope 1:** Direct emissions from the company’s operations.
     - **Scope 2:** Indirect emissions associated with electricity consumption.

   - These emissions are reported for the company’s major facilities, including the Taipei headquarters, Guishan R&D Division, and Kaohsiung Plant, ensuring a comprehensive accounting of emissions within operational boundaries.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions:**
   - While Scope 3 emissions are acknowledged, the report specifies that the current data **excludes indirect emissions from the use of company products**. However, Scope 3 data relevant to upstream and downstream activities, such as supply chain collaboration, is partially addressed through initiatives like the **Supply Chain Low-carbon Transition Coaching Program**.

3. **Carbon Reduction Efforts:**
   - USI highlights specific initiatives aimed at reducing carbon emissions:
     - **Energy Efficiency Projects:** Resulted in a total reduction of 1,614 metric tons of CO2e in 2023.
     - **Renewable Energy Investments:** Solar PV installations contributed to the generation of over 9 million kWh of green energy, aligning with the company’s long-term carbon neutrality goals.

---

### **Third-Party Verification**

The report confirms that the carbon emissions data is subject to third-party assurance:
1. **ISO Certification:** USI adheres to **ISO 14064-1:2018**, which governs the inventory and verification of greenhouse gas emissions. This ensures compliance with internationally recognized standards.
2. **Assurance Provider:** The report’s data, including GHG metrics, is audited by **Deloitte Taiwan** under the **Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000** framework. This verification process confirms the accuracy and reliability of the reported emissions data.

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Scope 1 and 2 Data:** Quantifiable emissions metrics provide clarity on USI’s carbon footprint across its primary operations.
2. **Third-Party Assurance:** Independent verification enhances the credibility and reliability of the data.
3. **Alignment with Standards:** The use of ISO 14064-1 ensures methodological rigor in emissions reporting.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Scope 3 Completeness:** Expanding the Scope 3 emissions inventory to include downstream impacts, such as product use, would provide a more holistic view of the company’s carbon footprint.
2. **Granular Data Breakdown:** Providing a detailed breakdown of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by source (e.g., transportation, manufacturing processes) would enhance transparency.
3. **Visual Representation:** Including charts or graphs to illustrate emissions trends over time could improve accessibility and stakeholder understanding.

---

In conclusion, the USI 2023 ESG Report provides robust and quantifiable data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, complemented by verified assurance from a third party. While Scope 3 emissions are partially addressed, expanding these disclosures would further strengthen the report’s comprehensiveness and alignment with global best practices in sustainability reporting.",0.7333333333333333,0.2105263156786703,0.6417030305884549,1.0,0.42,0.8234429365710825

Additionally, the report sets a long-term goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. These targets are indicative of a structured approach to climate action, emphasizing the importance of specific timelines and measurable milestones.

The report further emphasizes the annual disclosure of data related to Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions, which contributes to tracking progress against these targets. The organization reviews its achievement progress periodically, allowing for adjustments and strategic planning based on performance metrics. Specifically, the planned reduction strategy includes milestones for 2023, which has already achieved a 17% reduction over the baseline year, and outlines future actions aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon energy sources.

Moreover, the report indicates that an internal carbon pricing tool is planned for implementation within the next two years, which suggests a forward-thinking approach to managing carbon emissions and integrating climate-related financial considerations into decision-making. This structured framework not only holds the company accountable but also aligns with emerging best practices in sustainability reporting and climate action.

In summary, the emission reduction targets in the USI report are not only science-based but also include specific milestones and deadlines that facilitate effective tracking of progress towards achieving these important climate goals.","#### **Science-Based Emission Reduction Targets**

The USI 2023 ESG Report outlines ambitious emission reduction targets aligned with global climate objectives. While these targets demonstrate a strong commitment to reducing environmental impact, the report does not explicitly confirm alignment with a recognized science-based framework, such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). However, it provides clear milestones and deadlines, enabling effective tracking of progress toward these goals.

---

### **Emission Reduction Targets**

1. **Long-Term Target: Carbon Neutrality by 2050**
   - USI has committed to achieving **carbon neutrality by 2050**, aligning with the global goal of net-zero emissions. This target reflects a long-term strategic vision and positions the company as a leader in sustainable practices within its sector.

2. **Interim Target: 27% Reduction by 2030**
   - The report specifies a **27% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030**, using 2017 as the baseline year. This interim goal provides a measurable milestone, ensuring that progress toward the 2050 target can be monitored and adjusted as necessary.

3. **Specific Initiatives Supporting Targets:**
   - **Renewable Energy Development:** Expansion of solar PV installations to 15 MW by 2025 and 20 MW by 2027, with existing installations (7.2 MW) already generating over 9 million kWh of green energy annually.
   - **Energy Efficiency Projects:** Implementation of energy-saving initiatives resulting in a reduction of 1,614 metric tons of CO2e in 2023.
   - **Collaboration on Supply Chain Carbon Reduction:** Partnering with suppliers and customers to achieve a collective reduction of 10,000 metric tons of CO2 by 2025.

---

### **Milestones and Deadlines**

USI’s emission reduction framework includes clear milestones and deadlines, ensuring transparency and accountability:
1. **2023 Progress:**
   - Annual reduction in electricity consumption by 1.72%, exceeding the average reduction rate of 1.4% achieved between 2015 and 2023.
   - Completion of ISO 14064-1:2018 verification for greenhouse gas inventory, covering Scopes 1 and 2.

2. **2025 and 2027 Goals:**
   - Expansion of solar PV capacity as part of the renewable energy strategy.
   - Achievement of a supply chain carbon reduction target of 10,000 metric tons.

3. **2030 Target:**
   - A 27% reduction in emissions from 2017 levels, ensuring alignment with global decarbonization timelines.

4. **2050 Goal:**
   - Achievement of full carbon neutrality, marking the culmination of all ongoing and planned initiatives.

---

### **Strengths of the Targets**

1. **Alignment with Global Goals:**
   - The targets are consistent with international objectives, such as the Paris Agreement’s aim to limit global temperature rise to well below 2°C.
2. **Actionable Steps:**
   - Detailed action plans, including renewable energy installations and energy efficiency projects, provide a clear roadmap for achieving these targets.
3. **Measurable Milestones:**
   - Quantifiable interim targets and regular reporting ensure that progress can be tracked effectively.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Science-Based Certification:**
   - The report does not explicitly confirm that the targets have been validated as science-based through a framework like SBTi. Obtaining such certification would enhance credibility and stakeholder confidence.
2. **Detailed Baseline Data:**
   - While the report mentions 2017 as the baseline year, more granular details on baseline emissions and the methodologies used for calculations would provide greater transparency.
3. **Scope 3 Emissions Inclusion:**
   - Expanding the targets to include comprehensive Scope 3 emissions (e.g., downstream product use) would provide a more holistic view of the company’s climate impact.

---

### **Conclusion**

The USI 2023 ESG Report outlines clear and ambitious emission reduction targets, supported by actionable milestones and deadlines. While the targets demonstrate alignment with global decarbonization goals, the lack of explicit validation as science-based leaves room for improvement. Strengthening the targets through science-based certification, comprehensive Scope 3 inclusion, and enhanced baseline transparency would further reinforce the company’s commitment to sustainable practices.",0.6923076923076923,0.3157894735180055,0.6502300411787671,0.3809523809523809,0.45,0.861931985319825

This assessment is integrated into their overall risk management framework, which is guided by the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) recommendations.

Firstly, the organization identifies and categorizes climate-related risks using a framework that includes both physical risks, such as drought and flooding, and transition risks linked to regulatory changes, such as carbon fees and water consumption regulations. In 2023, the company conducted a comprehensive survey targeting its ESG Committee and senior management to evaluate the relevance and potential impact of various climate risks on operations. This process identified 12 significant climate issues, including one physical risk item, five transition risk items, and six opportunity items. The risks are further categorized based on their potential impact duration—short-term (less than three years), medium-term (three to five years), and long-term (greater than five years).

To quantify these risks, the company conducts scenario analyses, particularly under the RCP 8.5 climate scenario, which helps forecast potential financial impacts due to expected climate conditions from 2016 to 2035. This includes estimating variables such as temperature rises, rainfall patterns, and the likelihood of extreme weather events. The company also engages in annual risk assessments, wherein personnel designated by the president report on control measures and management performance to the Audit Committee and Board.

In terms of operational and financial disclosures, the company provides detailed reports on greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the financial implications of climate-related opportunities and risks. The ESG report includes specific metrics, targets, and countermeasures related to climate change, such as setting an ambitious goal of reducing carbon emissions by 27% from 2017 levels by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Moreover, the organization has established an internal carbon pricing mechanism to incorporate environmental costs into its investment evaluations, further enhancing its ability to manage financial risks posed by climate change.

Overall, the company's comprehensive approach enables it to systematically identify, assess, and disclose the myriad risks and opportunities arising from climate change, ensuring that stakeholders are informed of both current and future challenges.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks**

The USI 2023 ESG Report provides a detailed assessment and disclosure of the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. These disclosures align with internationally recognized frameworks and emphasize the company’s proactive approach to identifying, managing, and mitigating climate-related risks.

---

### **Assessment of Climate-Related Risks**

1. **Physical Risks:**
   - The report identifies **extreme weather events**, such as typhoons, floods, and droughts, as significant physical risks to its operations. These events could disrupt supply chains, damage infrastructure, and impact production processes, particularly at key facilities such as the Kaohsiung Plant.
   - Mitigation strategies include:
     - **Infrastructure Reinforcements:** Investments in facilities to withstand extreme weather conditions.
     - **Emergency Response Plans:** Implementation of contingency measures to ensure operational continuity during weather-related disruptions.

2. **Transition Risks:**
   - Regulatory changes related to climate policy, such as **carbon pricing mechanisms** and **emission reduction mandates**, are identified as critical transition risks. These could increase operational costs and necessitate additional investments in compliance and sustainability initiatives.
   - The report highlights USI’s alignment with global decarbonization targets, such as achieving **carbon neutrality by 2050**, as a key strategy to mitigate regulatory risks.

3. **Financial Implications:**
   - Climate risks are acknowledged as having potential financial impacts on the company, including increased capital expenditure for sustainability projects and potential revenue losses due to operational disruptions.

---

### **Disclosure Practices**

1. **Alignment with TCFD Recommendations:**
   - USI has adopted the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** framework to enhance the transparency of its climate risk management. The TCFD’s four core pillars—Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics & Targets—are integrated into the company’s disclosure practices.

2. **Governance Structure:**
   - Climate-related risks are overseen by the **Board of Directors**, which incorporates these considerations into strategic decision-making. This governance structure ensures that climate risks are prioritized at the highest level.

3. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - The report includes **scenario analyses** to assess the potential impacts of different climate-related scenarios, such as a 1.5°C or 2°C global temperature rise. These analyses help the company evaluate long-term risks and opportunities under varying regulatory and physical conditions.

4. **Quantitative Metrics:**
   - The company discloses greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2), energy usage, and renewable energy targets as part of its climate risk assessment. These metrics provide stakeholders with clear indicators of the company’s progress in mitigating climate risks.

---

### **Mitigation Measures**

1. **Carbon Reduction Initiatives:**
   - To address regulatory risks, USI has set clear emission reduction targets, including a **27% reduction by 2030 (from a 2017 baseline)** and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. These targets are supported by renewable energy projects and energy efficiency measures.

2. **Renewable Energy Investments:**
   - The expansion of solar PV capacity, with targets of 15 MW by 2025 and 20 MW by 2027, underscores the company’s commitment to transitioning to low-carbon energy sources.

3. **Risk Management Framework:**
   - The company has implemented a structured risk management process to continuously monitor, assess, and address climate risks. This includes periodic reviews and updates to reflect changing environmental and regulatory landscapes.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Framework Alignment:** Adoption of TCFD recommendations ensures a robust and transparent approach to climate risk disclosure.
2. **Proactive Risk Mitigation:** Investments in renewable energy and infrastructure demonstrate a proactive strategy to manage physical and transition risks.
3. **Governance Oversight:** Clear accountability at the Board level ensures climate risks are integrated into strategic decision-making.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Detailed Financial Quantification:** While the report acknowledges potential financial impacts, providing detailed quantitative assessments (e.g., cost implications of extreme weather events) would enhance transparency.
2. **Scope 3 Emissions Risks:** Including risks associated with Scope 3 emissions (e.g., supply chain impacts) would provide a more comprehensive risk profile.
3. **Sector-Specific Comparisons:** Benchmarking climate risk disclosures against industry peers could strengthen stakeholder confidence.

---

### **Conclusion**

The USI 2023 ESG Report demonstrates a thorough assessment and disclosure of climate-related risks, integrating internationally recognized frameworks such as TCFD. The company’s governance structure, scenario analyses, and proactive mitigation measures underscore its commitment to addressing the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. Expanding the scope of disclosures to include detailed financial impacts and Scope 3 risks would further enhance the report’s comprehensiveness and stakeholder relevance.",1.0,0.0312499999902343,0.9514825101402864,1.0,0.53,0.729590138216319

A key focus of these initiatives is the enhancement of board diversity through the appointment of directors with varied backgrounds, particularly aiming to include more female directors. The report mentions that 22% of directors are employees, and 44% are independent directors, indicating a commitment to diverse representation within the leadership structure. The Board of Directors has established comprehensive diversity objectives, responding to global trends emphasizing corporate sustainability and governance best practices.

In terms of workforce diversity, the report provides specific data on new employee hires categorized by gender, age, and region from 2021 to 2023. This data reveals ongoing efforts to maintain a balanced workforce. The hiring rates indicate a gradual increase in the proportion of female employees, though specific numbers are not detailed in the excerpts. The distribution of hires by age also suggests an inclusive approach, attracting talent across different age groups. 

Moreover, the company has implemented an equal salary and remuneration policy that seeks to eliminate pay discrimination based on gender, race, or other personal characteristics. This policy underscores the company's commitment to equitable treatment in its compensation practices, which is vital for fostering an inclusive workplace environment. 

Additionally, the company conducts employee satisfaction surveys and maintains open channels for feedback, reflecting a commitment to understanding and addressing employee concerns related to DEI. The findings from these surveys enable the company to assess its performance in fostering an inclusive workplace and guide future initiatives. Overall, the USI report demonstrates a structured approach to enhancing diversity and inclusion, supported by data and specific policies aimed at creating a more equitable work environment.","#### **Policies and Initiatives to Promote Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)**

The USI 2023 ESG Report highlights the company’s commitment to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) through a range of policies and initiatives. These efforts are designed to ensure equal opportunities, eliminate discrimination, and enhance inclusivity within the workplace.

### **Key Policies and Principles**

1. **Equal Opportunity Employment:**
   - The report emphasizes that USI does not tolerate discrimination based on factors such as race, gender, age, sexual orientation, religion, or physical disabilities. These principles are embedded in the company’s recruitment, retention, and promotion practices.

2. **Gender Equality:**
   - USI maintains a **policy of equal pay** for male and female employees. The report indicates that the remuneration structure is designed to be free from gender-based disparities, with female employees’ remuneration indexed to ""1"" to ensure parity.

3. **Workplace Protections:**
   - The company has established grievance channels to address workplace issues, including a dedicated mechanism for reporting sexual harassment. These systems ensure confidentiality and provide robust support to complainants.

4. **Commitment to Inclusive Governance:**
   - As part of its board diversity goals, USI is working to enhance gender representation by adding female directors. This is part of a broader effort to align with global corporate governance trends.

---

### **Specific Initiatives and Data**

1. **Employee Training and Development:**
   - USI provides training programs aimed at fostering DEI awareness and skill development among employees. In 2023, employees participated in professional training opportunities that reinforced the company’s commitment to inclusivity.

2. **Diversity Metrics:**
   - While specific representation data for gender or minority groups among the general workforce is not comprehensively detailed in the report, the company does provide a breakdown of employee educational backgrounds, roles, and turnover rates, which contribute to workforce diversity.

3. **Grievance Mechanisms:**
   - A well-defined complaint system addresses issues of discrimination and harassment, ensuring a safe and supportive environment for all employees.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
1. **Robust Policies:** USI’s commitment to non-discrimination and gender equality is clearly articulated in its policies.
2. **Transparent Governance Goals:** The inclusion of female directors as a stated objective reflects alignment with global DEI priorities.
3. **Comprehensive Benefits:** Parental and family care leave policies further support diversity by addressing the needs of a varied workforce.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Detailed Workforce Metrics:** The report could include more granular data on gender and minority representation across different levels of the organization.
2. **Impact Assessment:** Providing measurable outcomes of DEI initiatives (e.g., changes in gender representation or workplace satisfaction) would enhance transparency.
3. **Broader Inclusion Goals:** Expanding diversity objectives to include other underrepresented groups, such as ethnic minorities or individuals with disabilities, would demonstrate a more comprehensive approach.

---

### **Conclusion**

USI demonstrates a strong commitment to DEI through its policies and governance objectives. While the company has made significant strides in promoting gender equality and inclusivity, further enhancements in data transparency and expanded diversity goals would provide a more robust foundation for tracking and advancing its DEI performance.",1.0,0.0,0.6422330010432179,1.0,0.52,0.8515543095604994

A key component of these measures is the establishment of a robust Human Rights Policy that aligns with internationally accepted standards, such as the International Bill of Rights and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This policy is designed to ensure that all employees enjoy a safe and dignified working environment, free from discrimination, harassment, and forced or child labor.

To facilitate the reporting of grievances and concerns, USI has implemented unfettered grievance channels for employees. This includes dedicated mailboxes and emails for reporting issues such as sexual harassment, ensuring that all complaints are handled confidentially and without retaliation. Furthermore, new employees receive training on compliance topics, including human rights protection, sexual harassment prevention, and workplace safety, thereby embedding awareness and understanding of these issues from the onset of their employment.

In terms of compliance and oversight, the report mentions that the company actively conducts audits to assess adherence to its human rights policies. For example, it has implemented a Supplier ESG Commitment, which requires all current and new suppliers to sign a commitment letter. This initiative has reportedly achieved a 100% signing rate among suppliers. Additionally, the company has planned on-site supplier audits to monitor compliance with its Supplier’s Code of Conduct and Quality Requirements, focusing on the potential environmental and social impacts of their operations. 

In 2023, USI conducted audits at two suppliers, both of which passed the compliance checks. The report highlights the importance of these audits as a mechanism for identifying and addressing any negative impacts on human rights within the supply chain. This proactive approach not only safeguards labor practices but also reinforces the company's commitment to ethical corporate governance and sustainable development.

Overall, USI's measures include a combination of policy formulation, employee training, grievance mechanisms, and systematic audits to ensure the protection of human rights across its operations and supply chain.","#### **Safeguarding Human Rights Across Operations and Supply Chain**

The USI 2023 ESG Report provides comprehensive details about the company’s measures to safeguard human rights across its operations and supply chain. These efforts include explicit policies, due diligence processes, and mechanisms to ensure compliance with fair labor practices.

---

### **Human Rights Policies and Frameworks**

1. **Commitment to Human Rights:**
   - USI’s human rights policy aligns with internationally recognized standards, including the **International Bill of Rights** and the **Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work**. These policies aim to eliminate behaviors that prejudice or violate human rights.
   - Specific commitments include the elimination of child labor and forced labor, ensuring equal job opportunities, and creating a safe and dignified workplace for all employees.

2. **Training and Awareness:**
   - In 2023, USI conducted **5,134.5 hours of training** on human rights protection for 1,566 participants. This training covered topics such as sexual harassment prevention, non-discrimination, humane treatment, and occupational safety.
   - All new employees are required to undergo compliance training, including signing a commitment to adhere to human rights-related policies.

---

### **Human Rights Due Diligence and Monitoring**

1. **Risk Identification and Management:**
   - A total of 14 human rights issues were identified in 2023. The company implemented mitigation and compensation measures for eight significant concerns, ensuring a proactive approach to human rights risk management.
   - Regular workplace environment monitoring is conducted to address health and safety risks, supported by ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 certifications.

2. **Supply Chain Oversight:**
   - All suppliers are required to sign a **Supplier ESG Commitment**, agreeing to comply with human rights and fair labor practices. This requirement was achieved with a 100% signing rate by 2023.
   - USI conducted **on-site audits** for two suppliers in 2023, ensuring compliance with labor and human rights standards. These audits confirmed that suppliers do not employ child labor and adhere to occupational safety and health laws.

---

### **Grievance Mechanisms**

1. **Employee Channels:**
   - Employees can report workplace issues, including harassment or discrimination, through dedicated grievance channels. These reports are handled confidentially to protect the complainant’s identity.

2. **Supply Chain Compliance:**
   - Contractors and suppliers are evaluated periodically, with corrective measures implemented for non-compliance. In 2023, 186 contractor evaluations were completed, all of which passed compliance checks.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
1. **Robust Policy Framework:** Alignment with global human rights standards enhances the credibility of USI’s commitments.
2. **Effective Training Programs:** Comprehensive training ensures that employees and suppliers are well-informed about human rights policies.
3. **Proactive Supplier Engagement:** On-site audits and mandatory commitments demonstrate a strong supply chain oversight.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Expanded Scope:** Increasing the number of on-site audits for suppliers would provide deeper insights into compliance across the supply chain.
2. **Measurable Outcomes:** Reporting on long-term trends or impacts of human rights initiatives would improve transparency.
3. **Broader Risk Assessment:** Including additional risk areas, such as gender-based pay disparities, would strengthen the report's scope.

---

### **Conclusion**

USI’s 2023 ESG Report demonstrates a solid commitment to safeguarding human rights through detailed policies, robust training, and thorough supply chain oversight. While the company has made significant strides in promoting fair labor practices and ensuring compliance, expanding the scope of supplier audits and providing measurable outcomes for human rights initiatives would enhance its ESG performance further.",0.7894736842105263,0.049999999975,0.6932345656549228,1.0,0.68,0.8909400812370651

This committee is composed of the Chairman, the President, and three independent directors selected by the Board. Woody Duh, an independent director, serves as the Committee Chief, with Pei-Ji Wu, the President, acting as the Deputy Chief. The committee's term began on June 6, 2020, and will end on May 30, 2026. Its primary responsibilities include agreeing on sustainability development policies and strategies, overseeing their implementation, evaluating execution status, and approving the ESG reports.

The governance of ESG initiatives is further reinforced through regular reporting and integration into the broader corporate structure. The ESG Committee reports to the Board annually on the implementation results of sustainability development and holds discussions with various stakeholders to ensure alignment and address any concerns related to environmental protection, employee care, and community engagement. Additionally, the Operations Management Meeting, chaired by the Board Chairman, convenes monthly to review the planning and results of significant energy conservation and carbon reduction initiatives.

Moreover, the company emphasizes ethical corporate management and legal compliance within its governance framework. This involves regular assessments of the committee's performance, ensuring that sustainability goals align with corporate objectives. The ESG Committee's activities are integrated into the company's overall risk management approach, where climate-related risks and opportunities are identified, assessed, and managed, incorporating feedback from senior management. This comprehensive structure showcases the company's commitment to sustainability and effective governance through dedicated oversight and strategic integration of ESG principles.","#### **ESG Committee and Governance Structure**

Specifically, it has been audited by Deloitte Taiwan, which conducted an external assurance process in compliance with the GRI Standards: 2021. This verification confirms that the report adheres to the GRI guidelines for five Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) indicators.

The verification process involved several steps to ensure thoroughness and accuracy. It began with discussions of the report contents during a kickoff meeting, followed by preparation by three working teams. These teams were responsible for gathering and reviewing the necessary data. The head of data responsible departments then reviewed the findings, which were consolidated by team leaders. Further discussions and reviews were conducted among team members, culminating in proofreading and revisions. The process also included an internal evaluation by the Group Data Evaluation team, external assurance from Deloitte, and ultimately, approval from the ESG Committee and the Board of Directors for publication.

This structured approach not only enhances the credibility of the report but also provides assurance that it meets the established standards for ESG reporting.","#### **Verification and Audit of the ESG Report**

It outlines a clear vision to ""create and cohere sustainable value for a sustainable society,"" which serves as the foundation for its core strategies encompassing research and development, steady operations, and social inclusion.

Specificity and measurability of the ESG goals are evident within the report. For instance, USI has set a target to reduce carbon emissions by 27% by the year 2030, using 2017 as a baseline. This target is measurable and includes interim steps to assess progress, which aligns with the company's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Furthermore, the report discusses detailed plans for climate change and energy management, including equipment replacement, the construction of renewable energy facilities, and optimization of production schedules. These strategies are designed to mitigate physical risks associated with climate change, such as extreme weather events, and integrate seamlessly into the broader risk management framework.

The report also emphasizes the establishment of robust governance structures, such as the ESG Committee, which is responsible for overseeing climate-related risks and opportunities. Regular assessments and reports to the board ensure that the company's strategies remain aligned with its ESG objectives. The use of scenario analysis to evaluate potential financial impacts from climate-related risks highlights a proactive approach to long-term sustainability. 

In summary, the report articulates a clear roadmap for USI's ESG goals, supported by specific, measurable targets and detailed strategies for implementation. This ensures that the company is not only aware of its responsibilities but is also actively working toward achieving its sustainability objectives in a structured and accountable manner.","#### **Future ESG Goals and Strategies**
