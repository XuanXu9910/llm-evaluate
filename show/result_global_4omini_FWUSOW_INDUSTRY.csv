The reports indicate that there is a focus on sustainability initiatives and metrics within the organization, particularly regarding environmental management and the procurement of sustainable resources. However, the extent to which current ESG performance data is compared with historical data to highlight progress or trends over time appears to be limited.

### Current Initiatives and Progress

FWUSOW Industry Co., Ltd. has made significant strides in sustainability, particularly in the procurement of RSPO-certified palm oil and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Notably, emissions reported in 2023 showed reductions compared to 2022, suggesting progress in environmental management [Data: Reports (210, 256)]. Additionally, there has been a year-on-year reduction in ink usage, with specific figures documented for 2021, 2022, and 2023, which underscores the effectiveness of the company's environmental initiatives [Data: Reports (153)].

### Transparency and Historical Comparisons

While the reports emphasize the importance of transparency in sustainability practices, they also highlight a lack of explicit historical comparisons. This absence makes it challenging to assess the meaningfulness of the progress or trends over time. The focus seems to be more on current initiatives rather than providing a comprehensive analysis of historical performance [Data: Reports (27, 80, 54, 202, 37)]. Furthermore, while there are mentions of compliance with GRI Standards and the integration of audit findings into sustainability narratives, the overall transparency and meaningfulness of these comparisons may vary depending on the specific metrics and the context in which they are presented [Data: Reports (43, 178)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while there are indications of progress in sustainability initiatives, the reports do not provide sufficient historical comparisons to fully assess the trends in ESG performance. The lack of explicit historical data may hinder stakeholders' ability to gauge the significance of the reported improvements. Enhanced methodologies and clearer historical comparisons would be beneficial for a more comprehensive understanding of the company's sustainability performance over time.","### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. provides meaningful comparisons of its ESG performance data with historical data, demonstrating trends and progress across key sustainability indicators. This approach enhances transparency and enables stakeholders to evaluate the company’s commitments and achievements over time.

---

#### **Historical Comparisons in Key Performance Areas**

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Carbon Footprint:**
   - The report presents a year-on-year analysis of GHG emission intensity. For example, GHG emission intensity decreased from **2.36 kgCO₂/thousand $ in 2019** to **1.61 kgCO₂/thousand $ in 2023**, with intermediate targets set for 2025 and 2030. These comparisons highlight ongoing efforts to reduce emissions and align operations with climate action goals.

2. **Renewable Energy Adoption:**
   - Solar panel energy generation increased significantly, rising from **1,626 kW in 2019** to **4,181 kW in 2023**. This trend reflects the company’s investment in renewable energy as part of its Green Enterprise initiative.

3. **Sustainable Procurement:**
   - The report tracks the procurement of sustainably sourced materials, such as SSAP soybeans. For example, the use of SSAP soybeans decreased from **73,452 tons in 2019** to **61,931 tons in 2023**, with plans to increase usage to **95,488 tons by 2030**. This fluctuation is accompanied by commitments to enhance sustainable supply chain practices.

4. **Water Resource Management:**
   - The volume of water reclaimed and reused increased significantly, from **10,696 tons in 2019** to **21,162 tons in 2023**, showing notable progress in water conservation efforts.

5. **Product Innovation and Certifications:**

---

#### **Transparency and Meaningfulness of Comparisons**

1. **Clarity of Data:**
   - The report provides clear, year-by-year metrics across key environmental and operational areas, making trends easy to follow. Each data point is accompanied by context, explaining progress or shortfalls, which adds to the transparency of the disclosures.

3. **Alignment with Sustainability Goals:**
   - Historical data comparisons are directly tied to the company’s 3R strategy (Recycle, Reduce, Remodel) and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring that progress aligns with broader sustainability frameworks.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Broader Historical Context:**
   - While the report effectively compares recent years, extending comparisons further back (e.g., to 2015 or earlier) for critical areas such as GHG emissions or waste management could provide a more comprehensive view of long-term progress.

2. **Social Performance Metrics:**
   - Although the report includes data on employee benefits, occupational safety, and community engagement, these comparisons lack the same level of historical detail as environmental metrics. Incorporating multi-year trends in social performance would enhance the overall analysis.

3. **Visual Representation:**
   - The inclusion of additional charts or graphs comparing performance over time would make trends more visually accessible to readers and stakeholders.

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. provides detailed quantifiable data on its carbon emissions, covering multiple scopes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The report also highlights the third-party verification of these metrics, ensuring transparency and reliability.

---

#### **Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 Emissions**

1. **Scope 1 Emissions:**
   - Scope 1 emissions refer to direct emissions from company-owned or controlled sources. The report quantifies these emissions as part of its broader GHG inventory process. However, specific numerical data for Scope 1 emissions is not distinctly separated in the disclosed information. The focus is primarily on aggregated GHG reductions and improvements.

2. **Scope 2 Emissions:**
   - Scope 2 emissions, which are indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, or steam, are included in the company’s carbon accounting framework. The report mentions efforts to reduce these emissions through energy efficiency measures, including solar panel installations and equipment upgrades under the ISO 50001 Energy Management framework.

3. **Scope 3 Emissions:**
   - Scope 3 emissions, encompassing all other indirect emissions in the value chain, such as supplier and consumer activities, are partially addressed. Initiatives like sustainable procurement of SSAP soybeans and RSPO-certified palm oil, as well as reductions in transportation-related emissions via locally sourced raw materials, suggest attention to Scope 3-related impacts. However, explicit quantification of Scope 3 emissions is not provided.

---

#### **Third-Party Verification**

- The report emphasizes that the company’s GHG emissions inventory is verified and certified by an independent third party. This verification adds credibility and aligns with international reporting standards. Additionally, the company adheres to **GRI 2021 Standards**, which require rigorous reporting of environmental impacts.

- Specific certifications mentioned include:
