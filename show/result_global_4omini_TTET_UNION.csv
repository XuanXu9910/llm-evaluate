#### **Inclusion of Historical Data for Performance Comparison**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report incorporates historical data in several areas, providing a basis for tracking progress and identifying trends over time. These comparisons are presented transparently and focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) across environmental, social, and governance dimensions.

1. **Environmental Performance:**
   - The report provides data on energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and waste reduction measures. For example, the total energy savings in 2023 were reported as approximately 551.69 kWh, resulting in an estimated reduction of 272,535 kg of CO2e emissions. Although the report outlines this achievement, a detailed year-over-year comparison of energy efficiency or emissions reductions would enhance visibility into long-term trends.

2. **Economic Performance:**
   - Financial data, including operating revenue, costs, and pre-tax profits, are compared over three years (2021-2023). For example, the report highlights a decrease in operating revenue from NT$20.217 billion in 2022 to NT$18.488 billion in 2023, attributing the decline to reduced market demand and macroeconomic challenges.

3. **Food Safety and Product Quality:**
   - Certifications such as ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 are linked to product quality metrics. The report mentions that 97.06% of the net sales in 2023 came from products manufactured under certified systems, but historical comparisons for these certifications are not detailed, limiting trend analysis.

4. **Social Contributions:**
   - Workforce data, such as employee nationality (100% local employees in 2023) and the absence of foreign workers, are consistent year-over-year. However, metrics related to employee diversity, talent cultivation, or workplace satisfaction do not include historical trends.

---

#### **Meaningfulness of Comparisons**

The comparisons presented in the report are meaningful in several areas but could be enhanced to provide deeper insights:

1. **Strengths:**
   - Multi-year financial data enable stakeholders to assess economic resilience and identify trends in profitability and revenue performance.
   - Environmental performance metrics, such as energy savings and GHG reductions, demonstrate incremental progress toward sustainability goals.

2. **Areas for Enhancement:**
   - The report does not consistently use visual tools like graphs or tables to illustrate trends, which could improve accessibility and clarity.
   - Comparisons for social and governance metrics, such as employee engagement, diversity, or governance effectiveness, are limited or absent.

---

#### **Transparency in Reporting**

The report ensures transparency by disclosing the basis for its data and clarifying methodologies. For example, financial data is derived from audited financial statements, while environmental metrics are tied to ISO standards. Limited assurance by PwC Taiwan further enhances credibility. However, the lack of clear baseline data for some ESG initiatives, such as waste management or supplier compliance, reduces the ability to track progress comprehensively.

---

### **Conclusion**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report provides some comparisons of current performance with historical data, primarily in financial and environmental areas. While these comparisons are meaningful and transparent, expanding the scope of historical data across all ESG dimensions and visualizing trends would significantly enhance stakeholder understanding. Consistent inclusion of year-over-year data for social and governance metrics would also support a more holistic assessment of the company’s sustainability progress.",0.7272727272727273,0.1874999998828125,0.6738270011991556,1.0,0.34,0.8366019889211539
