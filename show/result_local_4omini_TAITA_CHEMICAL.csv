The organizational scope and time frame of the report are essential components for understanding the context and relevance of the information presented. In the case of the sustainability report, it is crucial to ascertain whether the report clearly defines these aspects.

#### Clarity of Scope

The report does not explicitly detail the specific parts of the company included in the reporting scope, such as subsidiaries or supply chains. However, it does mention that the organization engages in sustainability reporting, which encompasses a comprehensive overview of its governance, activities, and workforce [Data: Entities (653)]. This suggests a broad approach to sustainability reporting but lacks specificity regarding which subsidiaries or supply chain elements are included.

#### Time Frame

Regarding the time frame, the report references the year 2023 as relevant for assessing various aspects, including total compensation ratios and changes in compensation for directors and managers [Data: Relationships (2136)]. This indicates that the report is likely focused on the current year, but further details on the reporting period's start and end dates are not provided.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the report indicates a comprehensive approach to sustainability reporting, it does not clearly specify the organizational scope concerning subsidiaries or supply chains. Additionally, while the year 2023 is mentioned, the exact time frame for the reporting period remains undefined. This lack of specificity may limit stakeholders' understanding of the report's applicability and comprehensiveness.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the ESG Report**

The ESG report of Taita Chemical Company, Limited (TTC) clearly defines the organizational scope and time frame, providing transparency regarding the boundaries and coverage of the report. 

---

#### **Time Frame**

The report covers the period from **January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023**, with financial data consistent with the audited annual financial report. This aligns with standard reporting practices to ensure stakeholders can compare performance across defined time periods. The publication schedule is also disclosed, highlighting an **annual reporting cycle**, with the current report released in **August 2024** and the next publication scheduled for **August 2025**.

---

#### **Organizational Scope**

The report encompasses TTC's main operations, including the following facilities and subsidiaries:
- **Taipei Headquarters**
- **Qianzhen Plant**
- **Linyuan Plant (including the Kaohsiung Branch)**
- **Toufen Plant**
- **Zhongshan Plant** (located in mainland China)

Additionally, the report provides specific notes on the operational status of certain facilities:
- The **Tianjin Plant** in mainland China ceased production in **2019** due to market contraction. Its financial data is included, but no environmental data is reported.
- The **Zhangzhou Plant** has not yet commenced operations and is therefore excluded from environmental and operational disclosures.

Environmental data focuses on facilities actively contributing to production, ensuring the relevance and accuracy of the disclosed information.

---

#### **Inclusion of Supply Chain and Subsidiaries**

The report outlines TTC's value chain, describing the integration of upstream suppliers, internal operations, and downstream processing plants or clients. While the report highlights the involvement of **raw material suppliers** and the management of production processes, it does not provide detailed disclosures on supply chain performance or emissions outside its operational control.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Clearly defined time frame and annual reporting cycle.
   - Transparent inclusion of active operational sites, with exclusions justified (e.g., non-operational plants like Tianjin and Zhangzhou).
   - Consistency between environmental and financial reporting.

The TTC 2023 ESG Report provides a comprehensive overview of the organization's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives and performance metrics. However, the data tables do not explicitly indicate whether the report includes comparisons of current ESG performance data with historical data to highlight progress or trends over time. The focus appears to be on the current year's performance and initiatives rather than a longitudinal analysis.

### Transparency and Meaningfulness of Comparisons

While the report emphasizes various aspects of sustainability, including greenhouse gas emissions, economic performance, and social responsibility initiatives, it does not provide specific details on how these metrics compare to previous years. The absence of historical data comparisons may limit the ability to assess meaningful trends or progress over time. Transparency in reporting is crucial for stakeholders to understand the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives and the organization's commitment to continuous improvement.

The TTC 2023 ESG Report does adhere to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, which are designed to ensure compliance and facilitate effective stakeholder engagement. This adherence suggests a commitment to transparency in reporting practices, but without explicit historical comparisons, the report may not fully convey the organization's progress in ESG performance [Data: TTC 2023 ESG Report (0); GRI Standards (42); Reporting Practices (2034)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while the TTC 2023 ESG Report outlines various current initiatives and performance metrics, it lacks explicit historical comparisons that would allow stakeholders to gauge progress over time. The meaningfulness and transparency of the report could be enhanced by including such comparisons, thereby providing a clearer picture of the organization's sustainability journey and its commitment to continuous improvement in ESG practices.","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

Yes, the company has a dedicated Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Committee that plays a pivotal role in overseeing its sustainability efforts. This committee is an integral part of the Board of Directors and is responsible for assessing risks and opportunities related to ESG factors that are relevant to the company's operations. The ESG Committee ensures that sustainability initiatives are effectively implemented and aligned with the broader organizational goals, thereby integrating sustainability into the company's governance structure [Data: Entities (39, 607); Relationships (857, 934)].

## Structure and Responsibilities

The ESG Committee operates under the authority of the Board of Directors, which oversees its activities and reviews the sustainability reports generated by the committee. This hierarchical relationship ensures that the ESG Committee's findings and recommendations are communicated effectively to the Board, influencing governance decisions and ensuring that sustainability considerations are integrated into the organization's strategic direction [Data: Relationships (857, 934, 875)].

## Integration into Governance Structures

The data provided does not explicitly mention anti-corruption policies and procedures. However, it does highlight various aspects of corporate governance and sustainability reporting that may encompass anti-corruption measures indirectly. For instance, the **Corporate Governance** framework emphasizes accountability and ethical management, which are critical components of anti-corruption efforts [Data: Entities (485); Relationships (909, 2488)].
