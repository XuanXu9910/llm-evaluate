Additionally, the report aligns with the sustainability guidelines set by the Taiwan Stock Exchange, which governs the preparation and filing of sustainability reports by listed companies.

The GRI Standards, particularly GRI 1: Foundation (2021) and GRI 2: General Disclosures, are foundational to the report. FPC has utilized these standards to structure its disclosures, ensuring that critical information regarding organizational details, governance structures, and stakeholder engagement is clearly communicated. The report includes a comparison table for SASB, indicating that it has incorporated specific indicators related to greenhouse gas emissions and corporate governance, among others, which further demonstrates its adherence to recognized sustainability accounting practices.

In terms of alignment with these frameworks, FPC's report appears to be comprehensive. It includes a detailed disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, strategies for emissions reduction, and management approaches to various material issues. The report also provides qualitative narratives on energy management and the use of recycled materials, reflecting an in-depth approach to sustainability. Furthermore, the report addresses stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis, which are critical components of both GRI and SASB frameworks.

Overall, the ESG report from FPC not only follows recognized frameworks but also aligns well with their principles, showcasing the company’s commitment to sustainability and responsible governance.

The report covers the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. It indicates that the reporting is done in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, specifically referencing GRI 1: Foundation (2021) and GRI 2: General Disclosures.

In terms of organizational scope, the report specifies details regarding entities included in the sustainability reporting. It references the company's history and the structure of its operations, which suggests that it considers various parts of the organization. However, while it outlines the main products and brands, there is no explicit mention of the specific subsidiaries or supply chains included in the report. This could imply that the report focuses primarily on the corporate level, but a more detailed examination would be necessary for clarity on the inclusion of subsidiaries or supply chains.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The **2023 Sustainability Report of Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC)** clearly defines its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring transparency in its disclosures.

1. **Time Frame:**  
   - The report covers the period from **January 1 to December 31, 2023**, aligning its reporting period with the company’s fiscal year. This consistency ensures comparability of data across financial and sustainability reporting.
   - The report includes historical data where relevant, specifically noting comparisons to baseline years, such as 2020, for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions.

2. **Organizational Scope:**  
   - The report primarily focuses on **Formosa Plastics Corporation** and excludes the operations of its subsidiaries unless explicitly stated. This delineation ensures clarity in the boundaries of the data presented.
   - The **reporting boundary** encompasses FPC’s facilities and operations as specified in the company’s organizational structure. Significant efforts are made to align the reporting scope with FPC’s operational and environmental impacts, with separate disclosures for any exclusions or exceptions.

3. **Disclosure of Subsidiaries and Supply Chain:**  
   - While the report primarily focuses on FPC’s core operations, references are made to the broader **supply chain and partnerships**. Specific initiatives in collaboration with suppliers, such as waste reuse and hazardous material management, are highlighted to reflect the extended impact of the company’s ESG initiatives. However, the report does not provide comprehensive data for subsidiaries or the entire supply chain.

4. **Third-Party Verification:**  
   - The organizational scope and reporting processes are subject to **third-party verification by BSI**, as per the **AA1000AS v3 Type I Assurance** standard. This adds credibility to the defined boundaries and ensures that the disclosures are accurate and transparent.

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- The report provides a well-defined time frame and organizational boundary, ensuring consistency in its disclosures.  
- Clear indication of excluded entities and focus on FPC’s direct operations enhances the accuracy and relevance of the data.  
- Independent third-party assurance strengthens the reliability of the scope and boundaries.  

**Improvement Areas:**
- The inclusion of detailed disclosures for subsidiaries and the entire supply chain could provide a more comprehensive view of FPC’s ESG impact.  
- Clearer integration of supply chain impacts, particularly regarding upstream and downstream operations, would strengthen stakeholder understanding of FPC’s holistic ESG performance.

The organizational scope and time frame in FPC’s 2023 Sustainability Report are robustly defined, but expanding disclosures to include a broader operational context would enhance the overall transparency and comprehensiveness of the report.",0.1538461538461538,0.1111111109876543,0.8835389817598948,0.9333333333333332,0.36,0.644033368815456

This connection is articulated through a structured approach that integrates sustainability into various operational facets of the company, emphasizing the importance of corporate governance, risk management, and stakeholder engagement as foundational elements of its strategic framework.

Firstly, the report highlights the establishment of a Sustainable Development Committee led by senior executives, which is responsible for developing and supervising sustainable development strategies. This aligns with FPC's overarching goal of achieving long-term sustainability, as the committee is tasked with ensuring that all business practices reflect the company's commitment to environmental protection, social responsibility, and good governance. The integration of ESG considerations into decision-making processes demonstrates a proactive approach to embedding sustainability within the organizational culture and operational strategies.

Additionally, the report provides specific sustainability goals, such as a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and a commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050. These targets are not only ambitious but also actionable, as they are supported by qualitative narratives detailing strategies and methods for greenhouse gas management. By establishing clear targets and methods for achieving them, FPC articulates a direct connection between its sustainability goals and its operational performance, which is essential for maintaining competitiveness and compliance within the industry.

Moreover, the report addresses material issues that have been identified through stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis, reflecting the company's responsiveness to the needs and expectations of its stakeholders. This analysis informs the prioritization of ESG initiatives, ensuring that they are relevant and impactful. The identification of 13 material issues, which include greenhouse gas management, waste management, and employee safety, showcases how FPC's strategy is aligned with both corporate governance and sustainability objectives, making the connections clear and actionable.

In summary, FPC’s report effectively links its ESG initiatives to its overall business strategy through structured governance, clear sustainability targets, and responsiveness to stakeholder concerns. These connections are clearly articulated, providing a roadmap for actionable steps that the company can take toward achieving its sustainability goals while enhancing its business performance.","#### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) effectively establishes connections between the company’s ESG initiatives and its broader business strategy. These links are clearly articulated across various sections of the report and provide actionable insights into how ESG priorities are embedded into FPC's operations and long-term objectives.

1. **Integration of ESG and Business Goals:**  
   - FPC explicitly ties its ESG initiatives to its core business philosophy of **""Diligence, Perseverance, Frugality, and Trustworthiness""** and its vision of sustainable growth. The report emphasizes that ESG considerations are not standalone activities but are integrated into operational strategies, such as innovation, market diversification, and risk management.  
   - For instance, the company’s **investment in circular economy projects** aligns with its goal of enhancing resource efficiency and reducing operational costs, which are critical for maintaining competitiveness in the petrochemical industry.  

2. **Climate Change and Energy Transition:**  
   - The report highlights FPC’s alignment with the **2050 Carbon Neutrality goal**, which is an integral part of its strategy to remain resilient amid global energy and environmental transitions. Specific measures include transitioning to renewable energy, improving boiler efficiency, and adopting **advanced hydrogen production technologies**, ensuring the company stays competitive while adhering to climate-related mandates.  
   - These climate-related initiatives also directly support FPC's operational efficiency by reducing GHG emissions (a 7.3% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from the 2020 baseline) and mitigating regulatory and reputational risks.  

3. **Sustainability as a Competitive Advantage:**  
   - FPC incorporates **innovative product development**, such as differentiated and high-value-added products, as a core part of its strategy. For example, the development of **fully recyclable products** and **low-carbon plastics** is directly linked to customer demand for sustainable solutions, enhancing both brand value and market share.  
   - The company’s efforts in **AI and digital transformation** are strategically positioned to increase operational efficiency and foster innovation, with ESG initiatives such as reducing waste and enhancing process optimization seamlessly integrated into these broader efforts.  

4. **Stakeholder Engagement and Materiality:**  
   - The company’s materiality assessment identified **13 critical issues**, including climate change mitigation, energy management, and product R&D, ensuring that its ESG priorities are in line with stakeholder expectations. This alignment enables FPC to address both business risks and opportunities while fostering trust among stakeholders, including investors and customers.  

5. **Governance and Oversight:**  
   - The establishment of the **Sustainable Development Committee**, composed of independent directors, ensures that ESG issues are embedded in FPC’s governance structure. This approach strengthens accountability and ensures that ESG initiatives are actionable and aligned with business strategies.  

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- Clear articulation of how ESG initiatives drive operational efficiency and innovation, such as the alignment of climate strategies with business sustainability.  
- Effective integration of stakeholder feedback into the company’s strategy through a comprehensive materiality analysis.  
- Robust governance structures, such as the Sustainable Development Committee, to oversee the implementation of ESG priorities.  

**Improvement Areas:**
- While ESG-business linkages are well-documented, greater specificity on the financial outcomes of these initiatives (e.g., cost savings from energy transitions or revenue growth from green products) could enhance stakeholder understanding of their economic impact.  
- Expanding the discussion on supply chain impacts and how FPC collaborates with suppliers to align ESG objectives would provide a more comprehensive view.  

FPC’s report demonstrates a well-defined and actionable linkage between its ESG initiatives and its business strategy. By embedding sustainability into its operational and governance frameworks, the company ensures that it remains competitive and resilient while addressing pressing environmental and social challenges.",0.8947368421052632,0.0434782608506616,0.6696482835030473,1.0,0.63,0.9034386867483046

For instance, it provides specific figures for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across multiple years, such as Scope 1 emissions that decreased from 3,918,988 tons CO2e in 2021 to 3,542,116 tons CO2e in 2023. This representation of data not only illustrates a trend of reduction in emissions but also demonstrates the company's commitment to GHG management and its long-term goals for emission reductions.

The comparisons made in the report are meaningful and transparent. The report adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, which require organizations to present a clear narrative around their sustainability efforts. For example, Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) has set specific reduction targets—20% by 2025 and 40% by 2030 based on a 2020 baseline—with a long-term aim of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Such quantitative goals, alongside their historical performance data, provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the company's progress over time.

Moreover, the report includes qualitative narratives that explain the strategies and methods implemented for GHG management, enhancing the transparency of the presented data. By detailing the context behind the numbers, such as the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures, the report offers stakeholders insight into the company’s operations and the efficacy of its sustainability initiatives. Overall, the report balances quantitative data with qualitative insights, allowing for a holistic view of FPC's ESG performance and its trajectory towards sustainability.","#### **Comparison of ESG Performance Data with Historical Data**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) provides a structured and transparent comparison of current ESG performance data with historical data. These comparisons are designed to highlight progress, identify trends, and underscore the company's commitment to continuous improvement in its sustainability initiatives.

---

#### **Comparison Highlights**

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:**  
   - FPC compares its **Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions** from the baseline year of 2020 to the reporting year of 2023. The report reveals a **7.3% reduction in emissions**, amounting to a decrease of **630,000 tons CO₂e**. This data demonstrates progress toward the company's **2050 Carbon Neutrality** goal.  
   - The emission intensity has also declined significantly, from **6,205.40 tons CO₂e/NT$100 million** in 2020 to **5,324.22 tons CO₂e/NT$100 million** in 2023, representing a 14.2% improvement in efficiency.

2. **Energy and Water Conservation:**  
   - FPC completed **167 water-saving improvement projects**, achieving a daily saving of **3.998 million liters**. Historical data on water savings from previous years is not explicitly mentioned but would enhance transparency if included.  
   - Energy efficiency measures are also compared historically. For instance, **613 energy-saving improvement projects** were completed in 2023, resulting in a GHG reduction of **98,996 tons CO₂e/year**.  

3. **Waste Management:**  
   - The report tracks progress in reducing hazardous and non-hazardous waste over time. For example, the **reuse of sandblasting waste** has been implemented to reduce landfill waste by approximately **100 metric tons annually**. However, there is also acknowledgment of an 11.2% increase in waste landfill volumes compared to 2020, primarily due to increased production capacity. This transparency highlights both achievements and areas for improvement.

4. **Diversity of Products and Investments in Sustainability:**  
   - Comparisons are provided for differentiated product sales. The report notes a **6.2% increase in the sales volume of differentiated products in 2023 compared to 2022**, reflecting FPC’s focus on high-value and sustainable product lines.  
   - Investments in clean technology have also increased, with **NT$1.586 billion** allocated in 2023 compared to prior years, underscoring the company’s strategic focus on sustainability-driven innovation.

#### **Strengths in Comparisons**

- **Transparency:** The report provides specific numerical data and percentage changes, enabling stakeholders to evaluate FPC’s progress meaningfully.  
- **Comprehensive Scope:** Historical comparisons cover multiple ESG dimensions, including emissions, resource efficiency, and product innovation, offering a holistic view of sustainability performance.  
- **Acknowledgment of Challenges:** The report does not shy away from highlighting areas where performance has regressed, such as increased landfill waste, fostering credibility and stakeholder trust.  

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

- **More Comprehensive Historical Data:** While the report includes some historical comparisons, extending these comparisons across more years would provide a richer perspective on long-term trends. For example, a five-year comparison of emissions or waste metrics could better contextualize performance improvements.  
- **Standardized Benchmarks:** Establishing standardized benchmarks for key indicators (e.g., energy efficiency or water usage) across all reporting years would make comparisons more meaningful.  
- **Graphical Representation:** Including charts or visual trends for key metrics would enhance the accessibility and interpretability of data for stakeholders.

---

#### **Conclusion**

FPC’s 2023 Sustainability Report provides meaningful and transparent comparisons of current ESG performance data with historical data. While the report excels in showcasing progress and acknowledging challenges, further enhancement in historical coverage and the inclusion of standardized benchmarks would strengthen its ability to communicate long-term sustainability achievements.",1.0,0.249999999875,0.9053154635856068,1.0,0.58,0.8297811410415361

For Scope 1 emissions, FPC reported a total of 3,542,116 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The Scope 2 emissions, which pertain to indirect emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity and steam, amounted to 4,463,433 tons CO2e. Moreover, the Scope 3 emissions, capturing other indirect emissions across the value chain, totaled a substantial 11,845,359 tons CO2e. Thus, the overall carbon emissions, aggregating these three scopes, reflect the company’s comprehensive impact on greenhouse gas emissions.

Importantly, these metrics are verified by third-party organizations. The report indicates that FPC's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data has been subjected to independent verification in compliance with standards such as ISO 14064-1:2006 and the GHG Protocol. In particular, the verification was performed by SGS Taiwan Ltd. and the British Standards Institution (BSI), ensuring that the reported figures adhere to recognized standards of accuracy and reliability. This verification process adds credibility to the reported data, reinforcing FPC's commitment to transparency and accountability in its environmental impact reporting. 

Overall, the report not only presents detailed emissions data but also emphasizes the importance of independent verification to maintain trust in its sustainability claims.","#### **Quantifiable Data on Carbon Emissions**

The **2023 Sustainability Report of Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC)** provides detailed and quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions, covering Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However, there is no explicit mention of Scope 3 emissions in the report. Below is an analysis of the available information:

---

#### **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions**

1. **Quantifiable Metrics:**  
   - FPC reports that its **Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions for 2023 totaled 8.005 million tons of CO₂e**.  
   - This reflects a **7.3% absolute reduction** compared to the baseline year of 2020, equating to a reduction of 630,000 tons of CO₂e.  
   - Emissions intensity also shows improvement, declining from **6,205.40 tons CO₂e/NT$100 million** in 2020 to **5,324.22 tons CO₂e/NT$100 million** in 2023, a 14.2% improvement in efficiency.

2. **Reduction Targets:**  
   - FPC has set a clear target for reducing its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, aiming for a **20% reduction by 2025** and **40% reduction by 2030**, relative to 2020 levels.  
   - The company has also committed to achieving **carbon neutrality by 2050**, integrating this goal into its energy transition and operational strategies.

3. **Verification:**  
   - The reported data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions has been **independently verified by the British Standards Institution (BSI)** under the AA1000AS v3 assurance framework. This enhances the credibility and transparency of the metrics.

---

#### **Scope 3 Emissions**

- The report does not provide specific data or quantifiable metrics for Scope 3 emissions. While Scope 3 emissions typically represent a significant portion of a company's carbon footprint, their absence limits the comprehensiveness of FPC’s carbon disclosures.  
- The company may benefit from future disclosures that include Scope 3 emissions, covering upstream and downstream activities such as purchased goods, transportation, and product use.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- **Detailed Quantitative Reporting:** The inclusion of absolute and intensity metrics for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions demonstrates transparency and a commitment to measurable improvements.  
- **Clear Targets:** Long-term reduction goals (2030 and 2050) are well-defined and consistent with global sustainability benchmarks.  
- **Third-Party Verification:** Independent assurance from BSI adds credibility to the reported data.

**Improvement Areas:**
- **Inclusion of Scope 3 Emissions:** Expanding the scope of carbon reporting to include Scope 3 emissions would provide a more comprehensive view of the company’s carbon footprint.  
- **Breakdown of Emissions by Source:** A more granular breakdown of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (e.g., by operational activity or facility) would enhance stakeholder understanding.

#### **Conclusion**

FPC provides robust and transparent data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, supported by third-party verification, and demonstrates measurable progress toward reduction targets. However, the absence of Scope 3 emissions data represents an area for future improvement, which would enhance the comprehensiveness of the company’s carbon footprint analysis. By including Scope 3 disclosures, FPC can further align with best practices in sustainability reporting and provide stakeholders with a holistic understanding of its climate impact.",1.0,0.1578947367590027,0.603545215603691,1.0,0.28,0.8487227191491432

""]","The emission reduction targets outlined in the Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) report are indeed structured with specific milestones and deadlines, aligning them with the principles of science-based targets. FPC has established a clear framework for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, using the year 2020 as the baseline. Their targets include a short-term goal of achieving a 20% reduction by 2025, a medium-term goal of a 40% reduction by 2030, and a long-term aim of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.

To track progress effectively, the company has implemented a systematic approach to monitor GHG emissions and evaluate performance. In 2023, FPC reported an inventory of 8.005 million tons of CO2 equivalent, marking a reduction of 630,000 tons (7.3%) from 2020 levels. Furthermore, they have active plans for energy transition projects that are expected to contribute an additional reduction of 863,000 metric tons of CO2 compared to the baseline by 2025.

FPC’s strategy includes various initiatives such as transitioning from coal-fired to low or zero carbon energy, promoting energy-saving practices, and enhancing the use of renewable energy. These actions are complemented by an internal carbon pricing mechanism, set at NT$100 per ton of CO2e, which integrates carbon costs into the profit and loss statements of their operations, thereby facilitating accountability and performance tracking.

Overall, the targets set forth by FPC not only incorporate specific milestones and deadlines but also reflect a commitment to systematic management of emissions in alignment with scientific principles, contributing to their overarching goal of sustainable development and environmental stewardship.","#### **Evaluation of Emission Reduction Targets**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) outlines clear and quantifiable emission reduction targets that align with global sustainability objectives. These targets demonstrate the company's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and addressing climate change. Below is an analysis of whether these targets are science-based and if they include milestones and deadlines for effective tracking.

---

#### **Science-Based Nature of the Targets**

1. **Alignment with International Standards:**  
   - FPC’s emission reduction targets are consistent with international climate goals, specifically the **2050 Carbon Neutrality** objective. The company aims to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by **20% by 2025** and **40% by 2030** from the 2020 baseline.  
   - While the targets reflect ambitious commitments, the report does not explicitly state that these goals are **validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)** or other similar frameworks. Validation by such initiatives would confirm alignment with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C.

2. **Scope of Targets:**  
   - The emission reduction goals are currently limited to **Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions**, leaving Scope 3 emissions unaddressed. Including Scope 3 emissions would align FPC’s strategy more closely with comprehensive science-based target methodologies.

---

#### **Milestones and Deadlines for Tracking Progress**

1. **Defined Milestones:**  
   - FPC provides specific intermediate milestones, such as the **2025 reduction target of 20%** and the **2030 reduction target of 40%**, creating clear benchmarks for tracking progress toward the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.  

2. **Actionable Measures:**  
   - The report outlines tangible actions to achieve these milestones, such as transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and deploying advanced hydrogen production technologies. Examples include:
     - Installation of solar power systems to increase renewable energy usage.
     - Implementation of energy-saving projects, reducing **98,996 tons of CO₂e/year** in 2023.
     - Pilot projects for hydrogen-natural gas co-combustion in manufacturing facilities.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting:**  
   - Emission data and progress toward reduction targets are independently verified by the **British Standards Institution (BSI)**, ensuring transparency and accountability. Annual updates provide stakeholders with insights into progress, challenges, and adjustments to strategies.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- Clear, time-bound targets with specific milestones enhance the company’s accountability and provide stakeholders with a structured roadmap.
- Third-party verification of emissions data bolsters credibility and transparency.
- The integration of renewable energy and innovative technologies demonstrates forward-thinking strategies to meet reduction goals.

**Improvement Areas:**
- Explicit validation of targets by science-based frameworks (e.g., SBTi) would confirm alignment with global climate goals.
- Inclusion of **Scope 3 emissions** in reduction targets is essential for addressing the company’s total carbon footprint and aligning with best practices.
- Detailed financial implications and cost-benefit analysis of reduction initiatives could enhance stakeholder understanding of their feasibility and impact.

---

#### **Conclusion**

FPC’s emission reduction targets reflect a strong commitment to sustainability, with well-defined milestones and actionable strategies. However, the absence of explicit validation as science-based and the exclusion of Scope 3 emissions limit the comprehensiveness of the company’s climate strategy.

Renewable Energy Development Act - \nSetting Up Green Energy\n\nTransition Risk/Policy and Legal\n\nMedium Risks\n\nAnalysis of Current Risks and Opportunities (Potential Impact on the Company)\n\nThe amendment to the \""Renewable Energy Development Act\"" was legally passed in April 2019. Since the contracted capacity of our Linyuan Complex \nin the amount of 25,000 kW is larger than the 5,000 kW required by law, FPC is required to install 10% of the contracted capacity of renewable energy \nequipment, energy storage equipment, or purchase renewable energy certificates within 5 years, or else we must pay a payment in lieu. Response Strategy and Target\n\n \u25bc In order to comply with regulatory requirements, the Public Works Section has proposed to set up a demonstration site for renewable energy and \nhas conducted a preliminary assessment of the site and type of renewable energy to be installed. Since the main plants are located in the south-\ncentral part of Taiwan with strong sunlight, they are suitable for installing solar power generation equipment. After evaluation, over 5,000 kW of solar \nphotovoltaics will be installed to meet the requirements of regulations. \u25bc Intends to purchase wind power and green power certificates from Formosa Heavy Industries Corp. (FHI) to ensure that the use of renewable energy \n\nis safe and in compliance with laws and regulations. \u25bc Target: By 2025, 100% of all administrative areas in all complexes will use renewable energy. Case Example\n\n \u25bc The Renwu Complex has installed solar power generation facilities in order to increase the amount of renewable energy produced. As of 2023, a \ntotal capacity of 456 kW has been installed, resulting in the generation of 499 kWh of electricity. An application has been submitted to Taipower to \ntransition to self-consumption, supplying power to the administrative areas in all complexes. In addition, starting in 2025, we will purchase wind \npower from FHI. \u25bc After assessment, the Renwu carbon fiber plant is set up as a renewable energy demonstration site with 4,000 kW solar modules to generate 5.296 \n\nmillion kWh of power annually and to reduce 4,443 tons of carbon annually. The construction cost is about NT$240,000 thousand.""]","The report from Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) provides detailed information on energy usage and efficiency over the past three years, highlighting both total energy consumption and the percentage of renewable energy used. 

In terms of total energy consumption, FPC reported the following figures in gigajoules (GJ) for 2021, 2022, and 2023: 26,638,682 GJ; 24,496,157 GJ; and 24,101,059 GJ, respectively. The percentage of grid electricity consumed has varied slightly over these years, with values of 70% in 2021, 74% in 2022, and reducing to 69% in 2023. Notably, FPC did not consume any renewable energy from 2021 to 2023, indicating a persistent reliance on non-renewable sources for its energy needs during this period.

The report also outlines efforts to improve energy efficiency, including the completion of 501 power reduction improvement projects in 2023, which saved around 4,972 kWh of electricity, equating to a reduction of approximately 47,510 tons of CO2 emissions. Additionally, FPC has set specific targets aimed at reducing energy consumption per unit of production by 5% compared to the previous year, indicating a proactive approach towards enhancing energy efficiency.

Regarding renewable energy initiatives, FPC has outlined ambitious plans for future use.

Among them, the \""Formosa anti-bacterial \n\noyster shell powder\"" was awarded the Taiwan Circular Economy Outstanding Enterprises Award - Silver by the Ministry of \n\nEnvironment in 2023. Additionally, in collaboration with the Taiwan Textile Research Institute, we developed the world's first \n\n\""Formosa Functional PP Fiber.\"" This fiber is combined with eight PP material components, including breathable membranes, \n\nsewing threads, buttons, and zippers, to create a single-material PP Fully Recyclable Functional Jacket. This jacket won the \n\n2024 iF Design Award in Germany and was showcased at the Frankfurt Textile Exhibition in April 2024. This not only seize \n\nbusiness opportunities in high-performance functional clothing materials, it is also a major breakthrough in the realization of \n\nthe clothing recycling cycle. We hope to showcase Taiwan's petrochemical industry's sustainability to the world. The Company has long been committed to incorporating the United Nations SDGs into our core philosophy. We actively \n\npromote various sustainability initiatives, with a pledge to create a sustainable and better future for the planet. As of 2023, \n\nan accumulated investment of over NT$30 billion has been made in pollution prevention and control, energy conservation \n\nand  waste  reduction,  greenhouse  gas  reduction,  and  improvement  of  industrial  safety  and  fire  protection. As  a  result, \n\nthe treatment and emission of various pollutants were better than national regulatory standards. Regarding greenhouse \n\ngas inventory and reduction efforts, as of 2023, we have completed carbon footprint assessments for 76 major products. Greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) for 2023, verified by an independent third party, totaled 8.005 million tons \n\nCO2e/year. This represents an absolute reduction of 630,000 tons CO2e compared to the baseline year of 2020, a decrease of \n\n7.3%. The emission intensity is 5,324.22 tons CO2e/NT$ 100 million, which is also lower than the baseline year's 6,205.40 tons \n\nCO2e/NT$ 100 million, a decrease of 14.2%. Furthermore, according to the CDP, an international environmental assessment \n\nindicator, the Company achieved the highest rating of A in climate change, water security, and supply chain evaluation in the \n\n2023. These three achievements not only demonstrate improvement compared to 2022 but also position us among the leading \n\nchemical companies worldwide.

Response Strategy and Target\n\n \u25bc Since 2018, FPC has started promoting green product solutions and constructed green products in eight aspects, including energy efficiency, \nemission reduction, waste reduction, water saving, non-toxicity, health, recycled products, and safety. And from these eight aspects, we invest in \nR&D, develop differentiated and high-value forwardlooking green products, and accelerate the commercialization process, so as to turn climate \nchange issues into business opportunities to improve corporate value. \u25bc PP post-consumer recycled pellets are developed for plastic woven bag packaging to reduce the use of new materials and carbon emissions by \nmore than 30%.

This framework is deeply integrated into their overall risk management system, which is overseen by the Board of Directors and supported by various operational teams within the company.

To identify and evaluate climate-related risks, FPC employs a risk and opportunity matrix that categorizes risks based on their potential financial impact and likelihood of occurrence. This matrix helps the company classify risks into major, medium, and low categories, facilitating targeted management strategies. In particular, the company regularly reviews climate-related risks and opportunities, using scenario analysis to assess resilience against extreme weather events and other climate impacts. For instance, they analyze potential flooding and drought scenarios to understand how these events might affect their operations, such as revenue loss due to plant shutdowns or increased operational costs stemming from regulatory compliance.

In terms of regulatory changes, FPC is proactive in adapting to new policies, such as the ""Climate Change Response Act,"" which imposes carbon fees on major greenhouse gas emitters. The company engages with government and industry associations to develop feasible carbon emissions trading mechanisms, ensuring they remain compliant while also managing financial implications. The expected introduction of a carbon border tax by the European Union, for instance, is another regulatory change that FPC is preparing for by adjusting its operational strategies to mitigate financial risks.

On an operational level, FPC implements a regular monitoring system for energy and water consumption across its facilities. This is part of their broader strategy to develop climate change countermeasures, which aim to minimize the risk of operational disruptions due to extreme weather or resource scarcity. For example, they have set a target of zero days of shutdown due to flooding or water scarcity in a year, demonstrating their commitment to operational resilience.

Overall, FPC's approach combines systematic risk identification, proactive engagement with regulatory frameworks, and operational adaptations to mitigate the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. This holistic strategy not only aims to protect the company from potential disruptions but also aligns with their long-term sustainability goals, including a commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

Central to these efforts is the establishment of a robust framework aimed at preventing forced labor, child labor, and discrimination within the workplace. FPC signed a new Human Rights Policy in August 2019, which emphasizes the company's commitment to ensuring fair labor practices and the protection of employee rights. Additionally, the Diversity and Inclusion Policy and the Modern Slavery Statement, signed in March 2023, further reinforce FPC's dedication to creating a respectful and equitable working environment.

To enhance compliance with these human rights commitments, FPC actively engages its suppliers and contractors by requiring them to adhere to principles of ethical labor practices. The company mandates that suppliers sign an ""Integrity and Confidentiality Pledge,"" achieving a signing rate of 97.8% in 2023. This pledge signifies their commitment to upholding the same standards of conduct related to human rights and fair labor practices that FPC promotes internally.

In terms of audits and compliance checks, FPC has established an independent Audit Office under the Board of Directors, which conducts regular evaluations of business functions to ensure management efficiency and reduce operational risks. In 2023, the audit completion rate was 100% across 61 audit items, and no major deficiencies were identified. This rigorous internal auditing process helps proactively identify any potential deviations from human rights and labor standards, allowing the company to implement necessary improvements.

Furthermore, FPC emphasizes employee education and training regarding human rights and labor laws, conducting 44 sessions in 2023 to raise awareness among employees about their rights and the company's policies. Regular consultations and feedback mechanisms, such as the ""Operational Key-points for Employee Complaints,"" enable employees to report any grievances related to labor practices, ensuring that their voices are heard and addressed promptly.

Overall, FPC's comprehensive approach to safeguarding human rights includes policy commitments, supplier engagements, rigorous internal audits, and ongoing education, all of which contribute to a sustainable and equitable working environment.","#### **Measures to Safeguard Human Rights Across Operations and Supply Chain**

#### **Human Rights Policies**

1. **Modern Slavery Statement:**  
   - FPC has established a **Modern Slavery Statement**, which strictly prohibits forced labor, child labor, and any form of exploitation. The company ensures compliance with local labor laws at all operational sites and aims to create a respectful working environment. Suppliers and contractors are also required to adhere to these principles through mandatory agreements.

2. **Diversity and Inclusion Policy:**  
   - FPC emphasizes the value of diverse and inclusive workplaces, providing equal opportunities regardless of race, nationality, gender, or other personal characteristics. This policy supports employees’ rights to freedom of association and prohibits any form of discrimination or harassment.

3. **Commitment to Global Standards:**  
   - The company aligns with international labor and human rights frameworks, aiming to create a supportive and fair workplace. The policies were further reinforced through the signing of the human rights policy and Modern Slavery Statement in March 2023.

---

#### **Audits and Compliance Checks**

1. **Supplier Compliance Measures:**  
   - Suppliers and contractors must sign an agreement to comply with the company’s human rights and labor standards. Regular audits and face-to-face communications are conducted to assess adherence to these policies. In 2023, the signing rate for such agreements reached **97.8%**.

2. **Internal Audits and Education:**  
   - Internal audits are conducted to ensure compliance with human rights policies. The audit results showed no significant violations in 2023, reflecting strong adherence to established standards. Moreover, **44 human rights training sessions** were held, covering over **5,961 employees**, focusing on workplace rights and labor laws.

3. **Incident Reporting and Monitoring:**  
   - FPC has established clear reporting channels to address any human rights violations or workplace grievances. In 2023, there were no reported incidents of discrimination, harassment, or forced labor, demonstrating the effectiveness of the company’s monitoring mechanisms.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- **Comprehensive Policies:** The company’s Modern Slavery Statement and Diversity and Inclusion Policy establish a strong framework for protecting human rights.  
- **Supplier Engagement:** The requirement for supplier compliance agreements and regular audits ensures alignment across the supply chain.  
- **Employee Training:** Extensive human rights education enhances awareness and fosters a culture of respect and inclusion.

**Improvement Areas:**
- **Detailed Metrics:** While the company reports training sessions and compliance rates, it could benefit from publishing detailed metrics on supplier audit findings and follow-up actions.  
- **Broader Coverage:** Extending audits and compliance checks to lower-tier suppliers would further strengthen human rights safeguards across the supply chain.

Central to this effort is the Sustainable Development Committee, which was approved by the Board of Directors on May 10, 2022. This committee is composed of four independent directors along with the convener and deputy convener of the sustainable development project. The committee meets at least once a year to discuss and supervise the performance of sustainable development strategies, ensuring alignment with the company’s sustainability goals.

Additionally, FPC has appointed senior executives, including its Chairman, Mr. Jason Lin, as the convener of this committee, alongside President Mr. Wen-Bee Kuo and Senior Vice President Mr. Jerry Lin as deputy conveners. This leadership structure not only emphasizes the importance of sustainability at the highest levels of management but also facilitates the integration of sustainability considerations into the company’s overall strategy. The Sustainable Development Promotion Team, which operates under the committee, is tasked with developing and implementing sustainable development strategies, thereby embedding these efforts into the company's governance framework.

FPC's governance practices also include regular reporting to the Board of Directors on sustainability initiatives and risk management activities.

It includes specific, measurable targets that are clearly defined within the context of their sustainability strategies. 

For environmental goals, FPC has established explicit targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction, aiming for a 20% reduction by 2025 and a 40% reduction by 2030 compared to the baseline year of 2020. The ultimate goal is to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. These targets are accompanied by a systematic approach that includes the implementation of an internal carbon pricing mechanism, currently set at NT$100 per ton of CO2e, to encourage carbon reduction across all operational units. The report mentions that GHG emissions were tracked, with 2023 showing a total of 8.005 million tons CO2e, down from 8.635 million tons CO2e in 2020, reflecting an ongoing commitment to monitor and reduce emissions.

In addition to GHG management, FPC has outlined strategies for energy management, including reducing energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency. The report states specific initiatives such as promoting energy-saving improvements and transitioning to renewable energy sources, though it notes the current lack of renewable energy usage as a percentage of total energy consumption.

For water resource management, the company aims to reduce water consumption per unit of main products by 5% compared to the previous year, integrating water-saving measures and recycling practices to enhance resource efficiency. This is tracked through annual water footprint verifications and reviews.

Overall, the report not only sets clear and measurable goals but also details the strategies and methodologies FPC plans to employ to achieve these objectives. This structured approach indicates an awareness of the importance of accountability and progress monitoring in the company's broader ESG commitment.","#### **Future ESG Goals and Strategies**
