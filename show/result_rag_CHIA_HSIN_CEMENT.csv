1. **Transparency:**
   - The report provides clear year-over-year comparisons in key areas such as carbon emissions, energy efficiency, and governance ratings. These comparisons are supported by data verified through third-party assurance, ensuring credibility.

2. **Actionable Insights:**
   - The historical comparisons are tied to actionable initiatives, such as the installation of solar photovoltaic systems to meet energy and emissions targets, showing a direct link between past performance and future strategies.

3. **Comprehensive Environmental Metrics:**
   - The focus on carbon intensity and efficiency improvements offers a meaningful way to measure progress, even when absolute emissions increase due to external factors such as post-pandemic recovery.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Social Metrics:**
   - While the report includes qualitative updates on social initiatives, quantitative year-over-year comparisons, such as changes in employee satisfaction or training participation, are limited. Enhanced transparency in this area would provide a clearer picture of progress.

2. **Broader Historical Context:**
   - Historical data for some metrics, such as water usage, waste management, or Scope 3 emissions, is not consistently provided. Expanding comparisons to include these areas would offer a more holistic view of the company’s environmental and operational performance over time.

---

In summary, the ESG report provides meaningful and transparent historical comparisons in key areas, particularly environmental performance and governance. However, the inclusion of more comprehensive year-over-year data, especially for social and broader environmental metrics, would strengthen the report’s ability to demonstrate progress and trends effectively. This approach would further reinforce Chia Hsin Cement Corporation’s commitment to accountability and continuous improvement.",1.0,0.0,0.5510385758413746,0.9285714285714286,0.34,0.7733934860042917

According to the data, the company has implemented a quantitative approach to waste management, which includes tracking the total weight of waste generated, the percentage of hazardous waste, and the percentage of that waste which is recycled. For the year 2023, the report indicates a total waste generation of 378 tons, with a focus on recycling efforts, particularly noting that hotel waste recycling accounted for 38% of its total volume.

These strategies are measurable, as the report provides specific metrics and data related to waste management performance over the years. The indicators mentioned include the weight of total waste generated, the ratio of hazardous waste, and recycling rates, which are all disclosed in quantitative terms. This allows stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of the initiatives and track progress over time.

Additionally, the report highlights the company's commitment to sustainability through the development of green products and services, which aligns with principles of a circular economy. By actively managing waste and pursuing recycling initiatives, the Chia Hsin Cement Group aims to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainable operations, thereby reinforcing its dedication to corporate responsibility and sustainability goals.","#### **Waste Management Strategies in the ESG Report**

The ESG report of **Chia Hsin Cement Corporation** outlines the company’s strategies for waste management, emphasizing reduction, recycling, and the adoption of circular economy principles.

This process is rooted in compliance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, which guide the identification, assessment, and management of climate-related risks.

To begin with, the company identifies climate risks through a collaborative effort among different departments. Cross-departmental meetings are convened to discuss potential climate risks and opportunities, focusing on both physical and transitional risks. Physical risks include the increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as typhoons and floods, which can disrupt operations and impact revenue. Transitional risks arise from heightened regulations aimed at achieving national net-zero targets, which could impose additional costs on the company for compliance.

Once identified, these risks are assessed based on their potential operational and financial impacts. The assessment considers the likelihood and timing of risk occurrences, leading to a detailed evaluation of how these risks could affect revenue and operational capacity. For example, the company anticipates a potential revenue decrease of approximately 0.01% by 2025 due to extreme weather events, and estimates the impacts of regulatory changes on operating costs, which could increase by 0.005% to 0.084% by 2030.

In terms of disclosure, the company has integrated climate risk management into its overall risk management framework. It regularly reports on its risk management operations to the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee, ensuring transparency about how climate risks are managed and mitigated. Furthermore, it outlines its risk response strategies, such as implementing adaptation policies and energy management systems to enhance resilience against climate impacts. The company’s commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 and its plans for renewable energy initiatives further demonstrate its proactive approach to managing climate risks.

Overall, the company's comprehensive risk management framework, combined with its adherence to TCFD guidelines, ensures that it effectively identifies, assesses, and discloses the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. This approach not only helps mitigate potential impacts but also aligns with broader sustainability goals and regulatory expectations.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

This committee was formed during the 441st Board Meeting on December 14, 2021, and assumed responsibilities related to corporate governance, risk management, and corporate social responsibility (CSR) that were previously managed by the corporate governance unit established in 2019. 

At the helm of the Sustainable Development Committee is the Chief Sustainability Officer, who leads the Sustainable Development Office. This office is tasked with coordinating sustainability initiatives across the organization, ensuring that sustainability-related projects, such as environmental management and climate action, align with the company’s strategic goals. The Chief Sustainability Officer also reports to the Board of Directors on the progress of sustainability initiatives and the implementation of the company's climate strategy, highlighting their integral role in governance.

The Sustainable Development Committee conducts regular meetings to review and assess the implementation and effectiveness of the company's sustainability plans. This committee includes independent directors and is designed to ensure that sustainability is not only a focal point of corporate strategy but is also embedded in the overall governance framework. For example, in 2023, the committee held meetings to discuss greenhouse gas inventories and risks related to sustainability, demonstrating active engagement in the oversight of these critical issues.

In summary, Chia Hsin Cement Group's governance structure effectively integrates sustainability oversight through dedicated committees and executive leadership, ensuring that sustainability efforts are systematically managed and aligned with the company's operational objectives. This structure facilitates transparent communication with stakeholders and reinforces the company's commitment to responsible business practices.","#### **ESG Governance: Leadership and Oversight**

Furthermore, there are plans to conduct Scope 3 carbon inventories for the upstream and downstream supply chains in 2025-2026, which will provide a more complete picture of the company's carbon footprint and contribute to its reduction strategies.

Additionally, the report emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency improvements and the promotion of energy-saving measures across operations. The company has committed to evaluating the introduction of Energy Management Systems (EMS) in its buildings and replacing energy-consuming equipment with more efficient models. Such initiatives are designed to not only meet regulatory requirements but also to lower operational costs and improve environmental performance.
