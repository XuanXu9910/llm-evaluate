The report specifically aligns with the GRI Standards 2021 edition, which emphasizes transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting. This alignment is evidenced by the thorough incorporation of GRI's management approach and disclosure topics across various material aspects of the company’s operations.

In addition to GRI, the report references SASB standards, which provide sector-specific guidance on sustainability performance metrics, enhancing the report's relevance to investors and stakeholders interested in financial implications related to environmental, social, and governance factors. The TCFD framework is also utilized to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities, allowing APC to evaluate the potential financial impacts of climate change and to establish appropriate response strategies. This structured approach demonstrates a comprehensive integration of sustainability practices into the company's governance and operational strategies.

The report's adherence to these frameworks is robust, as it includes detailed disclosures on material topics, risk assessments, and performance metrics. For example, APC discloses its greenhouse gas emissions data categorized by scopes 1, 2, and 3, and it outlines carbon reduction targets based on 2017 as the baseline year, aiming for a 27% reduction by 2030. Additionally, the report reflects a commitment to stakeholder engagement and ethical corporate governance, aligning with GRI's principles of stakeholder inclusiveness and sustainability context.

Overall, the alignment with these frameworks not only enhances the credibility of APC's sustainability efforts but also facilitates a better understanding among stakeholders regarding the company’s environmental impact and governance practices. The report's focus on continuous improvement, as indicated by periodic reviews and updates in response to stakeholder feedback, further underscores its commitment to maintaining high standards in ESG reporting.","#### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The Asia Polymer Corporation (APC) ESG report specifies that it covers operational entities, including the Taipei headquarters, the Kaohsiung Linyuan Plant, and USI Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. This explicit mention ensures that stakeholders and the general public understand which portions of the company are included in the report.

The time frame of the report is also clearly outlined, indicating that it encompasses the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. This temporal scope allows for a comprehensive assessment of APC's non-financial performance and management of material topics within the specified timeframe. 

Moreover, the report indicates that it aligns with the outcomes of action plans related to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), further emphasizing its commitment to sustainability and transparency in reporting. Overall, the details provided in the report facilitate a nuanced understanding of APC's operations and sustainability efforts.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The ESG report of Asia Polymer Corporation (APC) clearly defines its organizational scope and time frame, providing stakeholders with transparency regarding the boundaries and applicability of the report.

1. **Time Frame:**  
   - The report covers the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. APC publishes its sustainability report annually, with the current issue released in August 2024. This ensures a consistent reporting cycle, facilitating year-on-year performance comparisons.

2. **Organizational Scope:**  
   - The report encompasses APC’s operational entities, specifically:
     - **Taipei Headquarters (HQ):** Responsible for sales operations.
     - **Kaohsiung Linyuan Plant:** Focuses on research and development, manufacturing, and shipment.
     - **USI Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.:** Included in the consolidated financial statements.
     - **USI Education Foundation:** Contributions and initiatives related to social engagement are also highlighted.

3. **Supply Chain Inclusion:**  
   - While the report details supply chain management practices, including supplier evaluations and environmental/social impact assessments, the direct scope of the report does not explicitly extend to all supply chain operations. However, supplier compliance with ESG criteria is emphasized, ensuring alignment with APC’s sustainability goals.

4. **Third-Party Assurance:**  
   - The report undergoes a limited assurance process conducted by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, in compliance with Standard on Assurance Engagement 3000. This ensures the credibility of disclosed information.

---

#### **Clarity and Completeness of Scope**

The scope is clearly delineated, ensuring stakeholders can identify which entities and activities are included. For instance:
- APC explicitly states that all financial information aligns with the consolidated financial statements certified by accountants.
- The report aligns with GRI Standards 2021, ensuring a structured approach to defining reporting boundaries.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Comprehensive disclosure of the operational scope and organizational entities covered.
   - Clear alignment with internationally recognized standards (GRI Standards 2021).
   - Inclusion of third-party assurance, enhancing reliability.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - While the operational entities are well-documented, the report could benefit from more explicit details about the inclusion or exclusion of specific supply chain elements.
   - Greater granularity on the environmental and social impacts of subsidiaries and third-party operations would provide a more holistic view.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Asia Polymer Corporation’s ESG report effectively defines its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring transparency for stakeholders. The inclusion of operational entities and third-party assurance strengthens its credibility, though further detailing of supply chain impacts could enhance its comprehensiveness. This approach aligns with best practices for sustainability reporting and supports informed decision-making by stakeholders.",1.0,0.3333333330555555,0.6342523576527137,1.0,0.49,0.832766547981807

This connection is articulated through a structured approach that emphasizes sustainability as a core aspect of the company's operational governance and long-term strategic goals.

APC has established an ESG Committee, chaired by independent directors, which serves as the highest governance body for climate change management. This committee is responsible for planning, implementing, and reporting on ESG initiatives, thereby ensuring that sustainable practices are integrated into the company's decision-making processes. The report highlights specific actions taken across various departments, such as the integration of climate-related risk assessments based on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, demonstrating a clear link between ESG considerations and financial performance (GRI 201-2). 

Furthermore, the report indicates that APC has set ambitious carbon reduction targets, aiming for a 27% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, using 2017 as the baseline year, and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. These targets encompass short-term initiatives like enhancing energy efficiency and long-term strategies focusing on low-carbon fuels and carbon capture technologies. This not only aligns with the company’s commitment to sustainable development but also positions APC to mitigate financial risks associated with climate change, thus reinforcing the actionable nature of these initiatives.

The report also connects ESG performance to business outcomes by emphasizing the importance of stakeholder engagement and the materiality analysis process. APC has identified significant ESG topics through a systematic evaluation of stakeholder concerns, ensuring that the company's sustainability objectives resonate with the interests of its various stakeholders. The material topics, including supply chain management and economic performance, are discussed in relation to their impact on the company's overall growth and competitive positioning in the market.

In conclusion, the APC 2023 ESG Report clearly articulates the connections between its ESG initiatives and business strategy. The company’s approach is not only structured and well-defined but also actionable, with specific performance targets and management strategies that are aligned with its long-term sustainability goals. This strategic integration of ESG principles demonstrates APC's commitment to creating value for stakeholders while addressing pressing environmental and social challenges.","#### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

The ESG report of Asia Polymer Corporation (APC) demonstrates a clear integration of ESG initiatives into the company’s overall business strategy. These connections are articulated through explicit commitments to sustainable development goals, detailed action plans, and alignment with core business operations. Below is an analysis of how the report links these elements:

#### **Strategic Alignment with ESG Goals**

1. **Sustainability Vision and Goals:**  
   APC’s business strategy is rooted in its sustainability vision: ""Create sustainable value for a sustainable society."" The report highlights three core strategic pillars—R&D and innovation, steady operations, and social inclusion—aligned with their ESG approach. These pillars are integrated into both short-term (2023–2025) and medium- to long-term (2026–2028) plans.

2. **Integration with Business Operations:**  
   ESG initiatives are designed to support operational goals, such as:
   - **R&D and Product Innovation:** APC emphasizes the development of higher-value products and green manufacturing technologies, directly supporting its competitive position in the global market.
   - **Operational Efficiency:** Energy efficiency measures and carbon reduction goals are embedded in production processes, aligning with both environmental and economic performance objectives.
   - **Social Responsibility:** APC actively engages in community development and workforce enhancement, which bolsters its reputation and operational stability.

3. **Linkage to Financial Performance:**  
   The report ties ESG efforts to economic performance by showcasing the value of sustainability investments. For example, APC aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 27% (compared to 2017 levels) by 2030, with the ultimate goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. These efforts are expected to lower operational risks and enhance long-term profitability.

#### **Articulation of Actionable ESG Initiatives**

1. **Clear Goals and Targets:**  
   The report includes measurable ESG targets, such as:
   - Increasing the installed capacity of solar PV systems to 15 MW by 2025.
   - Achieving a 78% recovery rate for intermediate bulk containers and implementing a comprehensive waste management program.
   - Maintaining a zero-accident workplace with robust safety measures.

2. **Alignment with International Standards:**  
   APC links its initiatives to global frameworks such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and TCFD, ensuring its actions align with global sustainability priorities. This alignment not only enhances the credibility of its strategy but also ensures its goals are relevant and actionable.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:**  
   The report underscores stakeholder inclusivity as a vital component of its strategy. By engaging with employees, customers, suppliers, and community members, APC ensures its ESG initiatives are well-integrated into broader business operations.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Comprehensive alignment of ESG initiatives with core business strategies.
   - Measurable, actionable goals that align with international frameworks such as SDGs and TCFD.
   - Clear integration of sustainability into financial performance and operational risk management.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - While the report provides substantial details, it could further enhance the linkage between specific ESG initiatives and individual business units or product lines.

For Scope 1 emissions, which refer to direct emissions from processes or facilities, the report states that the company reported 10,275 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2e) in 2023, accounting for 9.5% of total emissions. Scope 2 emissions, related to energy indirect emissions such as purchased electricity, were reported at 97,832 Mt CO2e, comprising 90.5% of total emissions. The total greenhouse gas emissions for the company in 2023 amounted to 108,107 Mt CO2e, reflecting a 1.1% reduction from the previous year.

In terms of Scope 3 emissions, which encompass indirect emissions not covered in Scope 1 and Scope 2, the report specifies that emissions from upstream transport and distribution, as well as purchased goods, were assessed, with a total of 307,865 Mt CO2e attributed to these categories.

Importantly, the report indicates that all data concerning Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions has been assured by a third-party organization, ensuring the credibility and reliability of the reported figures. This verification process enhances transparency and accountability regarding the company's greenhouse gas emissions management.","#### **Quantifiable Data on Carbon Emissions**

The ESG report of Asia Polymer Corporation (APC) provides detailed and quantifiable data on its carbon emissions, focusing primarily on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Below is an analysis of how these metrics are disclosed and the extent of third-party verification.

---

These targets are aligned with global climate goals and reflect a commitment to addressing climate change through measurable actions.

To effectively track progress, APC has established clear milestones and deadlines. The report specifies that the company reviews its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually, focusing on Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and provides updates on its performance against the set targets. For instance, APC reported a 7.7% reduction in carbon emissions in 2023 compared to the 2017 baseline, indicating that they are on track with their planned reductions. Additionally, they have outlined short-term (less than three years) and medium-term (three to five years) goals, which include specific actions such as enhancing energy efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon energy solutions.

Overall, the structured approach to emissions reduction, with defined targets, progress monitoring, and a commitment to transparency in reporting, reflects a robust framework for achieving science-based climate objectives.","#### **Evaluation of Emission Reduction Targets**

The ESG report of Asia Polymer Corporation (APC) outlines specific emission reduction targets that demonstrate a commitment to mitigating climate change. These targets are aligned with international standards and include milestones and deadlines to track progress effectively. Below is an analysis of the nature of these targets and their alignment with science-based methodologies.

---

#### **Science-Based Nature of Targets**

1. **Carbon Reduction Goals:**
   - APC has committed to achieving a **27% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030** compared to its baseline year of 2017. This target aligns with the global effort to limit temperature rise in accordance with the Paris Agreement, which is the foundation of science-based targets.

2. **Long-Term Commitments:**
   - The company aims to achieve **carbon neutrality by 2050**, a goal that reflects alignment with global net-zero initiatives. This commitment indicates APC's strategic focus on long-term decarbonization.

3. **Alignment with Frameworks:**
   - The company integrates the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework to evaluate climate-related risks and opportunities. While the report does not explicitly state certification under the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the targets are directionally consistent with science-based approaches.

---

#### **Milestones and Tracking Mechanisms**

1. **Interim Milestones:**
   - APC provides detailed progress metrics, including a **7.7% reduction in GHG emissions in 2023** relative to the 2017 baseline. This interim progress serves as a measurable step toward the 2030 target.

2. **Energy Efficiency Programs:**
   - The report highlights initiatives such as the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, with planned capacity expansions to **15 MW by 2025** and **20 MW by 2027**. These projects contribute to achieving emissions reduction milestones.

3. **Monitoring Systems:**
   - APC uses third-party verification, conducted by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, to ensure the accuracy and credibility of its emissions data and progress tracking. This external assurance enhances transparency and reliability.

---

#### **Strengths of the Targets**

1. **Specificity and Measurability:**
   - The targets are quantifiable, with clear baseline comparisons and year-on-year tracking of progress.

2. **Integration with Broader Goals:**
   - The alignment with the company’s sustainability strategies, such as energy efficiency, renewable energy adoption, and supply chain management, ensures a holistic approach to achieving emissions reductions.

3. **Transparency and Verification:**
   - The inclusion of third-party verification enhances trust in the reporting of progress and milestones.

#### **Conclusion**

Asia Polymer Corporation’s emission reduction targets are ambitious, actionable, and consistent with science-based principles, focusing on achieving significant reductions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. The use of interim milestones, renewable energy investments, and third-party verification underscores the company’s commitment to transparency and accountability. However, formal alignment with SBTi and expansion into Scope 3 targets would further strengthen the credibility and comprehensiveness of its climate strategy.",1.0,0.1999999999,0.6418595748825308,0.5,0.63,0.8476856913843167

For the year 2023, total energy consumption was reported at 805,494 gigajoules (GJ), with a significant portion being derived from electricity, which accounted for 695,742 GJ or 86.4% of the total energy consumed. Notably, the report indicates that there was no utilization of renewable energy in the total energy mix, as the percentage of renewable energy was recorded at 0%.

In terms of energy efficiency, the report highlights improvements in unit product energy consumption, which decreased to 6.09 GJ per metric ton (MT) in 2023, down from 6.23 GJ/MT in 2022. This represents a reduction of approximately 2.2%. Furthermore, the report outlines the average electricity conservation rate from 2015 to 2023 was 1.57%, indicating consistent efforts to enhance energy efficiency over the years.

Progress compared to previous years shows a continuous commitment to energy-saving initiatives. For instance, in 2023, the total energy saved through various management programs amounted to 516,000 kWh of electricity and 2,736 MT of steam, leading to a reduction of carbon emissions by 840 metric tons CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2e). The report also specifies plans for future energy-saving and carbon reduction programs, which aim to further improve efficiency and reduce emissions in upcoming years. 

Overall, while the report does not disclose any energy derived from renewable sources in 2023, it does provide a clear trajectory of progress in energy efficiency and conservation efforts across the past few years.","#### **Energy Usage and Efficiency in the ESG Report**

Asia Polymer Corporation’s ESG report provides robust data on energy usage and efficiency, demonstrating consistent progress in reducing energy intensity and integrating renewable energy. The company’s proactive investments in solar PV systems and green energy procurement underscore its commitment to sustainability. While the report is comprehensive, a deeper breakdown of renewable energy as a percentage of total energy use and expansion into Scope 3 metrics would further enhance its transparency and scope. This would solidify APC’s position as a leader in energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption within its industry.",1.0,,0.6186880719923059,1.0,0.26,0.701779786996116

This approach is grounded in the framework provided by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which facilitates the identification of climate-related risks and opportunities across various departments within the organization.

APC has identified a total of 24 potential risk and opportunity issues related to climate change, categorized into physical and transition risks. For instance, physical risks include flood inundation, drought, and high temperatures, each assessed for their degree of impact and likelihood of occurrence. Transition risks encompass government regulations, such as carbon taxes and renewable energy regulations, which could significantly affect operating costs and capital expenditures. The company regularly evaluates these risks based on their potential financial impacts, which are categorized as short-term, medium-term, or long-term.

To further refine their risk assessment, APC conducts scenario analyses to evaluate resilience against climate-related risks, although they plan to include more detailed scenario analysis methodologies in the future. The financial implications of identified risks are tabulated, detailing how extreme weather events might lead to increased capital expenditure or decreased asset value, while regulatory changes could raise operating costs or necessitate investments in low-carbon technologies. These assessments inform the company's strategic planning and risk management processes.

In terms of governance, the ESG Committee, supervised by the Board of Directors, is tasked with overseeing climate change management. This committee reports annually on the planning and performance related to climate initiatives, ensuring transparency and accountability in the company's response to climate risks. The company also has specific carbon reduction targets, such as achieving a 27% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 based on 2017 levels, which further illustrates their commitment to addressing climate change risks and adapting to regulatory changes.

APC discloses its findings and plans in its ESG reports, detailing the identified risks, their financial implications, and the strategies in place to mitigate these risks. This comprehensive approach not only enhances the company's resilience to climate-related challenges but also aligns with global sustainability goals and regulatory expectations.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks**

One of the primary commitments is to create a friendly and inclusive environment that respects various genders, ages, cultures, and backgrounds. This is part of a broader strategy to ensure that every employee can leverage their talents and contribute fully to the organization. The company actively promotes gender equality policies and engages in ongoing educational training to prevent workplace discrimination and assaults.

To support these initiatives, the company has established a dedicated Occupational Health and Safety unit that works alongside DEI efforts to foster a safe and supportive workplace. This includes regular employee health check-ups and monitoring of workloads to ensure fair work conditions. The company also emphasizes the importance of creating an environment where employees feel respected and accepted, which is crucial for enhancing employee engagement and productivity.

However, the data on gender and minority representation within the company highlights an area for improvement. As of the end of December 2023, all senior executives are male, indicating a lack of female representation at the executive level. While there are efforts to diversify the Board of Directors—such as increasing the number of independent directors and aiming for diversity in professional backgrounds—this has not yet translated into gender diversity among senior leadership.

Additionally, the overall workforce consists of 233 employees, including two individuals with disabilities, showcasing some level of inclusivity. Yet, the statistics related to gender representation among executives suggest that more targeted actions are needed to enhance female representation and ensure a truly diverse leadership team. This calls for continued efforts and possibly new initiatives to foster a more balanced and equitable workplace in terms of gender and minority representation. 

In conclusion, while the company has established a framework for promoting DEI, the data indicates that there is a significant opportunity for growth, particularly in enhancing female representation in leadership roles and ensuring that diversity goals are met across all levels of the organization.","#### **Policies and Initiatives for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)**

In terms of diversity, the report explicitly mentions that the Board of Directors comprises nine members, all of whom are male, highlighting an area where gender diversity is lacking. However, it notes that independent directors constitute 44% of the board, which is a positive aspect of diversity. Additionally, the company has made efforts to enhance board diversity by increasing the number of independent directors from three to four and appointing Mr. Chien-Ping Chen, who brings extensive experience from the financial sector, particularly in financial risk control. This move aligns with the company's objective to improve deliberation quality and enhance the board's overall capabilities.

Regarding ESG-related expertise, the report states that the board members possess a range of professional skills essential for corporate governance, including operational judgment, financial analysis, crisis management, and legal knowledge—critical areas for addressing ESG issues. Notably, it mentions that among the board members, some have specialized knowledge in legal and environmental matters, which is particularly relevant for the company's sustainability initiatives. The ESG Committee, which oversees the implementation of ESG strategies, is composed of the Chairman, President, and independent directors, ensuring that ESG considerations are integrated into the board's decision-making processes.

Overall, while there are notable shortcomings in gender diversity, the report reflects a structured approach to enhancing board diversity and emphasizes the importance of ESG expertise in governance practices.","#### **Structure of the Board of Directors**

This framework includes detailed reporting and processing procedures, as well as protection mechanisms for whistleblowers, allowing them to report unethical conduct through various channels, including an email and a hotline. The Audit Committee is responsible for handling these reports, and in 2023, there were no reports of noncompliance noted by the Audit Division, which indicates a level of effective implementation of these policies.

Furthermore, the report highlights APC's commitment to ethical corporate management through the establishment of several guiding documents, such as the “Ethical Corporate Management Best Practice Principles” and the “Code of Ethics Conduct for Directors and Managerial Officers.” These documents aim to foster a corporate culture that discourages unethical behavior and sets standards for the conduct of all employees, including directors and managers.

While the report mentions the existence of procedures and policies, it does not provide specific case studies or detailed outcomes related to the enforcement of these anti-corruption measures.

The company has set a clear carbon reduction target of 27% by 2030, using 2017 as the baseline year. This target is part of a broader commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The report outlines various short-term and long-term initiatives that contribute to this goal. For instance, immediate actions focus on replacing old equipment, enhancing energy efficiency, and installing solar power generation facilities. Over the medium term, the company aims to transition to low-carbon energy sources and improve intelligent monitoring systems to support these efforts.

Moreover, the report emphasizes regular disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 in the ESG report. The company also reviews progress annually, which allows for adjustments to be made based on performance and evolving circumstances. Specific metrics, such as the reduction of carbon emissions by 7.7% as of 2023 compared to the baseline, indicate that these goals are being tracked and assessed effectively.

In terms of governance, the ESG Committee oversees climate change management and reports on implementation and performance to the Board of Directors annually. This structured approach ensures that the ESG goals are not only aspirational but also supported by a robust management framework that facilitates accountability and progress tracking.

Overall, the report reflects a strategic and methodical approach to achieving ESG goals, with well-defined targets and actionable plans that demonstrate the company's commitment to sustainability and responsible corporate governance.","The uploaded ESG report does not explicitly detail how the company plans to achieve its future ESG goals, nor does it specify if these goals are measurable and accompanied by detailed strategies. For a more complete evaluation, additional documents or sections specifically addressing future ESG objectives and their implementation strategies would be required.
