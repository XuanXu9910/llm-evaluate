The ESG report adheres to several internationally recognized frameworks that guide sustainability reporting. Notably, it aligns with the **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)** standards, which are designed to assist organizations in disclosing their economic, environmental, and social impacts. The GRI plays a crucial role in promoting transparency and accountability in sustainability practices, and its standards are widely accepted globally [Data: Entities (31, 32, 2381, 11, 14)].

Additionally, the report follows the **Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)** guidelines, which focus on helping publicly listed companies disclose material sustainability information to investors. SASB's standards are tailored to various industries, ensuring that the sustainability disclosures are relevant and comprehensive [Data: Entities (28, 12, 638)].

The **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** framework is also referenced in the ESG report. TCFD provides recommendations for companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities, enhancing the quality of climate-related disclosures [Data: Entities (47, 1277, 1209)].

## Alignment with Frameworks

The alignment of the ESG report with these frameworks is robust. Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC), which prepares the report, utilizes the GRI standards to ensure compliance with sustainability reporting guidelines. This adherence is evident in their structured approach to reporting on sustainability issues, including economic performance and environmental impacts [Data: Relationships (660, 1697, 1693)].

Moreover, FPC references the SASB standards to enhance its sustainability disclosures, indicating a commitment to recognized standards in environmental and social governance practices. This alignment demonstrates FPC's intention to improve transparency and accountability in its sustainability efforts [Data: Relationships (12, 638)].

In summary, the ESG report is well-aligned with internationally recognized frameworks such as GRI, SASB, and TCFD, ensuring that it meets global standards for sustainability reporting. This alignment not only enhances the credibility of the report but also supports informed decision-making among stakeholders [Data: Relationships (1209, 139)].","#### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The organizational scope and time frame of the report are indeed clearly defined. The report outlines the various categories of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically focusing on Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 refers to direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organization, while Scope 2 encompasses indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the reporting entity. Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain, which is particularly significant for understanding the broader environmental impact of the organization [Data: Entities (1474, 1476, 1473); Relationships (535, 536, 29)].

### Inclusion of Subsidiaries and Supply Chains

The report explicitly mentions the inclusion of subsidiaries in its emissions reporting. Subsidiaries are responsible for conducting their own GHG emissions inventories and verifications, although they are excluded from the main financial statements of the parent organization, Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) [Data: Entities (44); Relationships (668, 1766)]. This indicates that while the subsidiaries' emissions are accounted for, they are treated separately in terms of financial reporting.

Furthermore, the report emphasizes the importance of Scope 3 emissions, which capture the emissions from the entire value chain, including upstream and downstream activities. This broadens the scope of the report to encompass not just the direct operations of the company but also the environmental impacts associated with its supply chains [Data: Entities (1474); Relationships (2304)].

### Conclusion

In summary, the report provides a comprehensive overview of its organizational scope and time frame, clearly defining the categories of emissions and specifying the inclusion of subsidiaries and supply chains in its analysis. This thorough approach ensures that stakeholders have a clear understanding of the company's sustainability practices and the environmental impacts of its operations.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The **2023 Sustainability Report of Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC)** clearly defines its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring transparency in its disclosures.

1. **Time Frame:**  
   - The report covers the period from **January 1 to December 31, 2023**, aligning its reporting period with the company’s fiscal year. This consistency ensures comparability of data across financial and sustainability reporting.
   - The report includes historical data where relevant, specifically noting comparisons to baseline years, such as 2020, for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions.

2. **Organizational Scope:**  
   - The report primarily focuses on **Formosa Plastics Corporation** and excludes the operations of its subsidiaries unless explicitly stated. This delineation ensures clarity in the boundaries of the data presented.
   - The **reporting boundary** encompasses FPC’s facilities and operations as specified in the company’s organizational structure. Significant efforts are made to align the reporting scope with FPC’s operational and environmental impacts, with separate disclosures for any exclusions or exceptions.

3. **Disclosure of Subsidiaries and Supply Chain:**  
   - While the report primarily focuses on FPC’s core operations, references are made to the broader **supply chain and partnerships**. Specific initiatives in collaboration with suppliers, such as waste reuse and hazardous material management, are highlighted to reflect the extended impact of the company’s ESG initiatives. However, the report does not provide comprehensive data for subsidiaries or the entire supply chain.

4. **Third-Party Verification:**  
   - The organizational scope and reporting processes are subject to **third-party verification by BSI**, as per the **AA1000AS v3 Type I Assurance** standard. This adds credibility to the defined boundaries and ensures that the disclosures are accurate and transparent.

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- The report provides a well-defined time frame and organizational boundary, ensuring consistency in its disclosures.  
- Clear indication of excluded entities and focus on FPC’s direct operations enhances the accuracy and relevance of the data.  
- Independent third-party assurance strengthens the reliability of the scope and boundaries.  

**Improvement Areas:**
- The inclusion of detailed disclosures for subsidiaries and the entire supply chain could provide a more comprehensive view of FPC’s ESG impact.  
- Clearer integration of supply chain impacts, particularly regarding upstream and downstream operations, would strengthen stakeholder understanding of FPC’s holistic ESG performance.

The organizational scope and time frame in FPC’s 2023 Sustainability Report are robustly defined, but expanding disclosures to include a broader operational context would enhance the overall transparency and comprehensiveness of the report.",0.9,0.0,0.5967476593542766,0.5909090909090909,0.31,0.7821859562755651

The connection between the company's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives and its overall business strategy is articulated through various reports and initiatives that emphasize sustainability as a core component of the company's operations. The **2023 Sustainability Report** serves as a comprehensive document that outlines the company's extensive sustainability efforts, including its commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050 and various projects aimed at energy conservation and carbon reduction [Data: Entities (40, 1); Relationships (1, 539)]. 

### Clear Articulation of Connections

The reports clearly articulate how ESG initiatives are integrated into the company's business strategy. For instance, the **2023 Performance Tracking** initiative evaluates the effectiveness of the company's risk management and safety assessments, ensuring that these aspects align with its sustainability goals [Data: Relationships (2502, 897)]. This systematic approach allows the company to monitor its performance against established ESG targets, making the connections between sustainability efforts and business outcomes actionable.

Moreover, the company employs internal carbon pricing as a strategic tool to manage the financial impacts of climate-related issues, which further illustrates the integration of ESG considerations into its financial planning and operational strategies [Data: Relationships (2514)]. This approach not only enhances sustainability efforts but also positions the company to respond effectively to market demands and regulatory expectations.

### Actionable Insights

The actionable nature of these connections is evident in the detailed metrics and initiatives outlined in the sustainability reports. For example, the **2023 Sustainability Report** highlights specific achievements in greenhouse gas emissions management, water conservation, and social responsibility initiatives, such as gender equality and employee welfare [Data: Entities (40, 1); Relationships (664, 551)]. These metrics provide stakeholders with clear insights into the company's progress and areas for improvement, fostering accountability and informed decision-making.

In summary, the company's ESG initiatives are intricately linked to its overall business strategy, with clear articulation and actionable insights provided through comprehensive reporting. This alignment not only enhances the company's sustainability performance but also supports its long-term business objectives, ensuring that ESG considerations are embedded in its operational framework.","#### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) effectively establishes connections between the company’s ESG initiatives and its broader business strategy. These links are clearly articulated across various sections of the report and provide actionable insights into how ESG priorities are embedded into FPC's operations and long-term objectives.

1. **Integration of ESG and Business Goals:**  
   - FPC explicitly ties its ESG initiatives to its core business philosophy of **""Diligence, Perseverance, Frugality, and Trustworthiness""** and its vision of sustainable growth. The report emphasizes that ESG considerations are not standalone activities but are integrated into operational strategies, such as innovation, market diversification, and risk management.  
   - For instance, the company’s **investment in circular economy projects** aligns with its goal of enhancing resource efficiency and reducing operational costs, which are critical for maintaining competitiveness in the petrochemical industry.  

2. **Climate Change and Energy Transition:**  
   - The report highlights FPC’s alignment with the **2050 Carbon Neutrality goal**, which is an integral part of its strategy to remain resilient amid global energy and environmental transitions. Specific measures include transitioning to renewable energy, improving boiler efficiency, and adopting **advanced hydrogen production technologies**, ensuring the company stays competitive while adhering to climate-related mandates.  
   - These climate-related initiatives also directly support FPC's operational efficiency by reducing GHG emissions (a 7.3% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from the 2020 baseline) and mitigating regulatory and reputational risks.  

3. **Sustainability as a Competitive Advantage:**  
   - FPC incorporates **innovative product development**, such as differentiated and high-value-added products, as a core part of its strategy. For example, the development of **fully recyclable products** and **low-carbon plastics** is directly linked to customer demand for sustainable solutions, enhancing both brand value and market share.

These comparisons are designed to highlight progress, identify trends, and underscore the company's commitment to continuous improvement in its sustainability initiatives.

---

#### **Comparison Highlights**

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:**  
   - FPC compares its **Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions** from the baseline year of 2020 to the reporting year of 2023. The report reveals a **7.3% reduction in emissions**, amounting to a decrease of **630,000 tons CO₂e**. This data demonstrates progress toward the company's **2050 Carbon Neutrality** goal.  
   - The emission intensity has also declined significantly, from **6,205.40 tons CO₂e/NT$100 million** in 2020 to **5,324.22 tons CO₂e/NT$100 million** in 2023, representing a 14.2% improvement in efficiency.

2. **Energy and Water Conservation:**  
   - FPC completed **167 water-saving improvement projects**, achieving a daily saving of **3.998 million liters**. Historical data on water savings from previous years is not explicitly mentioned but would enhance transparency if included.  
   - Energy efficiency measures are also compared historically. For instance, **613 energy-saving improvement projects** were completed in 2023, resulting in a GHG reduction of **98,996 tons CO₂e/year**.  

3. **Waste Management:**  
   - The report tracks progress in reducing hazardous and non-hazardous waste over time. For example, the **reuse of sandblasting waste** has been implemented to reduce landfill waste by approximately **100 metric tons annually**. However, there is also acknowledgment of an 11.2% increase in waste landfill volumes compared to 2020, primarily due to increased production capacity. This transparency highlights both achievements and areas for improvement.

4. **Diversity of Products and Investments in Sustainability:**  
   - Comparisons are provided for differentiated product sales. The report notes a **6.2% increase in the sales volume of differentiated products in 2023 compared to 2022**, reflecting FPC’s focus on high-value and sustainable product lines.  
   - Investments in clean technology have also increased, with **NT$1.586 billion** allocated in 2023 compared to prior years, underscoring the company’s strategic focus on sustainability-driven innovation.

---

#### **Strengths in Comparisons**

- **Transparency:** The report provides specific numerical data and percentage changes, enabling stakeholders to evaluate FPC’s progress meaningfully.  
- **Comprehensive Scope:** Historical comparisons cover multiple ESG dimensions, including emissions, resource efficiency, and product innovation, offering a holistic view of sustainability performance.  
- **Acknowledgment of Challenges:** The report does not shy away from highlighting areas where performance has regressed, such as increased landfill waste, fostering credibility and stakeholder trust.  

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

- **More Comprehensive Historical Data:** While the report includes some historical comparisons, extending these comparisons across more years would provide a richer perspective on long-term trends. For example, a five-year comparison of emissions or waste metrics could better contextualize performance improvements.  
- **Standardized Benchmarks:** Establishing standardized benchmarks for key indicators (e.g., energy efficiency or water usage) across all reporting years would make comparisons more meaningful.  
- **Graphical Representation:** Including charts or visual trends for key metrics would enhance the accessibility and interpretability of data for stakeholders.

---

#### **Conclusion**

FPC’s 2023 Sustainability Report provides meaningful and transparent comparisons of current ESG performance data with historical data. While the report excels in showcasing progress and acknowledging challenges, further enhancement in historical coverage and the inclusion of standardized benchmarks would strengthen its ability to communicate long-term sustainability achievements.",0.9,0.0416666666493055,0.632937161034567,0.6363636363636364,0.36,0.8698440107025529

The report does provide quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions, specifically detailing Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. Each of these categories represents different sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the company's operations.

### Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 Emissions

- **Scope 1 Emissions**: These are direct GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the company. Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) reports its Scope 1 emissions as part of its greenhouse gas inventory [Data: Relationships (535), (524), (2166), (3389), (3380)].

- **Scope 2 Emissions**: These emissions are indirect and result from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the company. FPC also reports its Scope 2 emissions, which are calculated based on emission factors [Data: Relationships (536), (705), (3186), (2303), (2428)].

- **Scope 3 Emissions**: This category includes all other indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain, both upstream and downstream. FPC tracks and reports these emissions as part of its sustainability reporting efforts [Data: Relationships (526), (2487), (1474), (2304), (3386)].

### Verification of Emissions Data

The emissions metrics reported by the company are indeed verified by third parties. For instance, the GHG Emission Verification Report is a key document used by FPC to report on their greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring compliance and accuracy in environmental reporting [Data: Relationships (379), (1496), (3377), (3379), (3394)]. Additionally, the company adheres to standards such as ISO 14064-1: 2018 for quantification and reporting of GHG emissions, which further supports the credibility of their reported data [Data: Relationships (29), (1145), (1073)].

### Conclusion

In summary, the report provides comprehensive and quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions across all three scopes, with third-party verification ensuring the reliability of these metrics.

3. **Monitoring and Reporting:**  
   - Emission data and progress toward reduction targets are independently verified by the **British Standards Institution (BSI)**, ensuring transparency and accountability. Annual updates provide stakeholders with insights into progress, challenges, and adjustments to strategies.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- Clear, time-bound targets with specific milestones enhance the company’s accountability and provide stakeholders with a structured roadmap.
- Third-party verification of emissions data bolsters credibility and transparency.
- The integration of renewable energy and innovative technologies demonstrates forward-thinking strategies to meet reduction goals.

**Improvement Areas:**
- Explicit validation of targets by science-based frameworks (e.g., SBTi) would confirm alignment with global climate goals.
- Inclusion of **Scope 3 emissions** in reduction targets is essential for addressing the company’s total carbon footprint and aligning with best practices.
- Detailed financial implications and cost-benefit analysis of reduction initiatives could enhance stakeholder understanding of their feasibility and impact.

   - The policy also promotes the idea of leveraging diverse perspectives and talents to enhance competitive advantage.

2. **Modern Slavery Statement:**

---

#### **Key Initiatives and Actions**

   - While the male-to-female employee ratio is reflective of industrial characteristics (approximately 9.2:1), FPC actively promotes gender equality through structured promotion pathways. For example, the proportion of female supervisors at **management level 2 and above** has grown steadily, reaching **7.8% in 2023**, compared to 6.5% in 2021.

2. **Support for Individuals with Disabilities:**  
   - FPC exceeds legal requirements for hiring individuals with disabilities, employing **61 people with physical and mental disabilities**. These employees are provided with equal benefits and career development opportunities to support their integration into the workforce.

3. **Age Diversity:**

- **Quantifiable Progress:** Metrics on gender diversity and local representation reflect measurable progress in DEI initiatives.

The report outlines several key measures that Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC) has implemented to safeguard human rights across its operations and supply chain. Central to these efforts is the **Human Rights Policy**, which was signed by the Chairman of FPC in August 2019. This policy serves as a comprehensive framework aimed at preventing forced labor and discrimination, thereby reinforcing the organization's commitment to fostering a respectful and equitable environment for all individuals [Data: Entities (1794); Relationships (1433)].

FPC emphasizes **Human Rights Protection** as a critical aspect of its operations, ensuring that manufacturers adhere to established human rights standards. This commitment is reflected in the company's practices and policies, which are designed to promote ethical treatment of employees and prevent any violations of their rights [Data: Entities (445); Relationships (839)]. Additionally, the **Human Rights Management** policies are specifically tailored to ensure that there are no incidents of discrimination or labor violations within the organization [Data: Entities (2004); Relationships (1551)].

## Audits and Compliance Checks

To ensure compliance with fair labor practices, FPC conducts regular audits and compliance checks as part of its **2023 Performance Tracking** initiative. This initiative includes systematic evaluations of various operational aspects, including adherence to labor laws and rights protection. Annual training on labor law is also part of this performance tracking, which helps to reinforce the importance of compliance among employees [Data: Entities (539); Relationships (2789)].

Moreover, the **Material Issues Report** outlines the analysis of corporate impacts and the management policies adopted to address them, focusing on identified material issues related to human rights and labor practices [Data: Entities (420); Relationships (833)]. This report serves as a tool for FPC to review and report on its performance regarding human rights, ensuring that the organization remains accountable and transparent in its operations.

In summary, FPC has established a robust framework for safeguarding human rights through its policies and compliance measures, which are regularly monitored and evaluated to ensure adherence to ethical standards across its operations and supply chain.","#### **Measures to Safeguard Human Rights Across Operations and Supply Chain**
