ESG Report

The ESG report prepared by Uni-President adheres to several internationally recognized frameworks, primarily the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. These frameworks provide structured guidelines for organizations to report on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, ensuring transparency and accountability.

### Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

The GRI Standards are a comprehensive set of guidelines developed to facilitate sustainability reporting. Uni-President compiles its ESG report in accordance with these standards, which helps ensure that the organization effectively communicates its economic, environmental, and social impacts [Data: Entities (141), Relationships (29, 676)]. The GRI framework is widely recognized and utilized globally, making it a cornerstone for sustainability reporting.

### Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)

In addition to GRI, Uni-President refers to SASB standards for sustainability reporting, particularly in the food industry. This alignment with SASB standards allows the company to disclose material sustainability information that is relevant to investors and stakeholders [Data: Relationships (32)]. SASB's focus on industry-specific metrics enhances the relevance and comparability of the reported data.

### Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

The TCFD framework is also integrated into Uni-President's ESG reporting practices. The ESG Committee implements TCFD recommendations to manage climate-related risks and opportunities, ensuring that the organization addresses climate-related financial disclosures effectively [Data: Relationships (1440)]. This alignment with TCFD guidelines underscores the company's commitment to addressing climate change and its impacts on business operations.

## Alignment with Frameworks

Uni-President's ESG report demonstrates a strong alignment with these frameworks, as it incorporates the essential elements required for comprehensive sustainability reporting.

The integration of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives into a company's overall business strategy is crucial for fostering sustainable growth and maintaining stakeholder trust. In the case of Uni-President, the connection between its ESG initiatives and business strategy is articulated through various reports and governance structures.

### Clear Articulation of ESG Connections

Uni-President's ESG Committee plays a pivotal role in aligning sustainability efforts with the company's strategic objectives. This committee is responsible for overseeing the implementation of corporate governance practices and ensuring that sustainability reporting reflects the company's commitments to ESG principles [Data: Relationships (1436, 947, 1411)]. The committee regularly reviews material topics related to sustainability, which helps in identifying key areas where ESG initiatives can enhance business performance [Data: Relationships (1426, 1417)].

The company's annual and sustainability reports serve as vital resources that detail how ESG practices are embedded within its operational framework. For instance, the 2023 ESG Report builds on previous findings to continue the analysis of sustainability goals and performance tracking, demonstrating a commitment to transparency and accountability [Data: Entities (140, 253); Relationships (1807, 718)]. These reports not only outline the company's ESG strategies but also provide insights into how these strategies contribute to overall business objectives, such as risk management and stakeholder engagement.

### Actionable Connections

The actionable nature of these connections is evident in the structured approach Uni-President takes towards its ESG initiatives. The ESG Committee collaborates with various functional groups within the organization to ensure that sustainability goals are integrated into daily operations and decision-making processes [Data: Relationships (1411, 1419)]. This collaboration facilitates the development of specific initiatives that address climate-related risks and opportunities, thereby enhancing the company's resilience and adaptability in a changing market environment [Data: Relationships (1438, 1440)].

Moreover, the company’s commitment to ethical management and environmental sustainability is reflected in its operational practices, such as supplier assessments and adherence to food safety standards [Data: Relationships (1891, 1901)]. By implementing these practices, Uni-President not only complies with regulatory requirements but also positions itself as a responsible corporate citizen, which can lead to improved brand reputation and customer loyalty.

### Conclusion

In summary, Uni-President effectively links its ESG initiatives to its overall business strategy through a well-defined governance structure and comprehensive reporting mechanisms. The connections are clearly articulated and actionable, allowing the company to integrate sustainability into its core operations while addressing stakeholder concerns and enhancing its competitive advantage. This strategic alignment underscores the importance of ESG factors in driving long-term business success and sustainability [Data: Entities (21, 253); Relationships (1414, 1416)].","#### **Integration of ESG Initiatives with Business Strategy**

Uni-President Enterprises demonstrates a clear and deliberate alignment between its ESG initiatives and overall business strategy, as outlined in the 2023 ESG report. The report reflects the company’s recognition that sustainability is integral to long-term value creation, both for stakeholders and the organization. Below is an evaluation of how effectively these connections are articulated and actionable.

---

#### **Alignment with Strategic Objectives**

1. **""One Core and Four Gears"" Strategic Framework:**
   - Uni-President’s overarching business strategy, termed ""One Core and Four Gears,"" places brand management at the core of its operations. This strategy is supported by four pillars: manufacturing and R&D, trade and logistics, experience and retail, and alliances and acquisitions. ESG initiatives are seamlessly embedded within these pillars. For instance:
     - **Manufacturing and R&D:** Emphasis on food safety, nutrition, and sustainable packaging supports innovation while aligning with consumer expectations for healthier and environmentally friendly products.
     - **Trade and Logistics:** Efforts to reduce carbon emissions and implement renewable energy in logistics operations, such as the solar photovoltaic deployment at the Xinshi Logistics Park, demonstrate alignment with climate-related goals.

2. **Integration of ESG Metrics into Leadership Performance:**
   - ESG indicators are included in the performance evaluation of senior executives, including the company’s Presidents. This linkage ensures accountability and alignment between ESG objectives and business outcomes, driving actionable progress across all levels of the organization.

---

#### **Actionable Connections**

1. **Sustainability in Operations:**
   - The report highlights tangible actions, such as reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2.14% and Scope 3 emissions by 32,394 metric tons CO2e in 2023. These reductions are directly tied to the company's long-term goal of a 38% reduction in GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. Such measurable targets ensure that sustainability goals are actionable and progress is trackable.

2. **Sustainable Product Innovation:**
   - ESG initiatives are driving innovation in product development. For example, the application of R-PET packaging materials and reductions in plastic use (5.99 metric tons in 2023) align with both consumer preferences and regulatory trends for sustainable consumption. These efforts support the company's market competitiveness and environmental stewardship.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - The company’s social responsibility programs, such as scholarships for disadvantaged students and community canteen projects for the elderly, align with the strategic objective of fostering social harmony. Investments totaling NT$15.47 million in social care initiatives are impactful and reflect an actionable commitment to societal well-being.

---

#### **Clarity and Articulation**

1. **Strategic Reporting:**
   - The report clearly articulates how ESG initiatives contribute to business resilience and long-term growth. For instance, climate-related strategies under the TCFD framework are positioned as essential for ensuring supply chain stability and mitigating operational risks due to environmental changes.

2. **Goals and Progress Tracking:**
   - The inclusion of short-, medium-, and long-term ESG goals (e.g., water consumption efficiency, renewable energy adoption) provides clarity on how initiatives align with and support overall business objectives.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - ESG initiatives are deeply integrated into the company’s strategic framework, ensuring alignment across operational and leadership levels.
   - Specific and measurable goals, such as GHG reductions and sustainable packaging adoption, enhance accountability.
   - Clear communication of progress, such as through quantitative data on emissions and waste reduction, demonstrates transparency.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - While the report provides a comprehensive overview of ESG initiatives, more detailed financial quantification of the benefits from these initiatives (e.g., cost savings from energy efficiency) could further illustrate the value-add to the business strategy.
   - Expanded discussion on international operations’ contributions to ESG goals would enhance the global applicability of the strategy.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Uni-President Enterprises effectively links its ESG initiatives to its broader business strategy, with clear articulation and actionable commitments. By embedding sustainability into core operations, product innovation, and leadership accountability, the company showcases a cohesive approach to integrating ESG principles into its pursuit of long-term business success. Opportunities remain to strengthen the quantification of ESG-driven business outcomes and expand the scope of reporting on global operations.",0.7142857142857143,0.0,0.6430722743240532,0.8536585365853658,0.42,0.8699802645714496

The reports produced by Uni-President, particularly the ESG Reports and Sustainability Reports, do indeed compare current ESG performance data with historical data. The 2023 ESG Report builds upon the findings from the 2022 report, continuing the analysis of sustainability goals and performance tracking [Data: Entities (140, 28); Relationships (13, 27)]. This continuity allows stakeholders to observe trends and progress over time, which is essential for assessing the effectiveness of sustainability initiatives.

Moreover, the Sustainability Reports prepared by Uni-President are mandated by the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation, requiring listed companies to disclose their ESG practices and performance annually. This regulatory framework ensures that the comparisons made in these reports are not only meaningful but also adhere to established standards for transparency and accountability [Data: Entities (21, 2358); Relationships (2398, 938)]. The reports include specific sustainability indicators that must be disclosed, which further enhances the clarity and relevance of the data presented [Data: Entities (2684, 3871); Relationships (3869)].

### Meaningfulness and Transparency of Comparisons

The meaningfulness of these comparisons is bolstered by the involvement of the ESG Committee, which oversees the integrity of the sustainability reports. This committee is responsible for reviewing the content and ensuring that the information presented is accurate and reflective of the company's actual performance [Data: Entities (114, 949); Relationships (947, 948)]. Additionally, the Internal Audit function reviews the sustainability report's content, further ensuring that the comparisons made are reliable and transparent [Data: Entities (2324, 948); Relationships (948)].

In summary, the ESG performance data comparisons in Uni-President's reports are designed to be meaningful and transparent, supported by regulatory requirements and internal oversight mechanisms. This approach not only highlights progress over time but also fosters trust among stakeholders regarding the company's commitment to sustainability.","#### **Comparison of ESG Performance Data with Historical Data**

The ESG report of Uni-President Enterprises provides meaningful comparisons of current ESG performance data with historical data, effectively highlighting progress and trends over time. This approach ensures transparency and allows stakeholders to evaluate the company’s performance trajectory.

---

#### **Use of Historical Data**

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:**
   - The report compares Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions intensity, noting a 2.14% reduction in 2023 compared to the previous year. For Scope 3 emissions, a significant reduction of 32,394 metric tons CO2e was achieved. These comparisons align with the company’s long-term goal of reducing emissions by 38% below 2005 levels by 2030.

2. **Resource Efficiency:**
   - Historical data on the efficiency of raw material output is presented for key production inputs. For instance, the tea output rate improved to 95.45%, meeting the target, while fresh milk output rate marginally fell short at 96.81%. These data points reflect efforts to optimize resource use despite operational challenges.

3. **Water Usage:**
   - Water withdrawal intensity decreased by 1.11% in 2023 compared to the prior year, showcasing progress in sustainable water management. Historical trends are used to reinforce the company’s commitment to reducing water consumption over time.

4. **Waste Management:**
   - The waste recycling rate at production plants remained above the target of 95%, with a 2023 rate of 95.64%, indicating consistent performance in waste reduction.

5. **Plastic Use Reduction:**
   - The report highlights a reduction of 5.99 metric tons of plastic in 2023. While this figure is presented as progress, the report provides context for improvement by estimating further reductions of 20 tons annually in the future.

---

#### **Transparency and Relevance**

1. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - The report consistently uses quantitative data to compare performance across years, enabling stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of the company’s sustainability strategies. For example, energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy adoption are tracked over time, showing a cumulative impact.

2. **Challenges and Limitations:**
   - In instances where performance did not meet targets, such as the soybean output rate, the report provides transparent explanations (e.g., climate variability affecting crop yields). This candid approach enhances credibility.

3. **Alignment with Goals:**
   - Comparisons are tied to long-term ESG goals, such as GHG emissions reductions and resource optimization, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of how historical progress aligns with future ambitions.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The report includes detailed year-over-year comparisons for critical ESG metrics, reinforcing the narrative of continuous improvement.
   - Transparent disclosure of underperformance, along with corrective measures, adds credibility to the data.
   - The use of quantitative benchmarks, such as recycling rates and energy savings, ensures that comparisons are actionable and meaningful.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - While historical data comparisons are robust, additional visualization tools (e.g., trend graphs or dashboards) could enhance stakeholder understanding of long-term trends.
   - Expanding historical data coverage to include financial impacts of sustainability initiatives (e.g., cost savings from energy efficiency) would provide a more comprehensive picture of ESG performance.

---

#### **Conclusion**

The ESG report of Uni-President Enterprises effectively uses historical data to showcase progress and trends in key sustainability areas. These comparisons are transparent and meaningful, reflecting the company’s commitment to continuous improvement.

This process involves identifying climate-related risks, including those stemming from extreme weather events, and assessing their implications for business strategy and financial performance [Data: Relationships (410); Entities (1310)]. The assessment is crucial for understanding how climate change can disrupt operations, supply chains, and overall business continuity.

### Governance and Management

Effective governance structures are essential for managing climate-related risks. The company has established governance frameworks that oversee the management of these risks, ensuring accountability and strategic alignment with sustainability goals [Data: Relationships (1886); Entities (2516)]. The **ESG Committee** plays a pivotal role in this governance, implementing TCFD recommendations and overseeing the management of climate-related risks and opportunities [Data: Relationships (944, 1438, 1440)].

### Disclosure Practices

In terms of disclosure, the company follows the TCFD guidelines to enhance transparency regarding its climate-related financial risks. This includes reporting on how climate change impacts its financial performance and operational strategies, thereby enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions [Data: Relationships (941); Entities (20)]. The TCFD framework emphasizes the importance of disclosing both risks and opportunities, which allows the company to communicate its resilience and strategic responses to climate challenges effectively.

### Conclusion

Overall, the company's approach to assessing and disclosing climate-related risks is multifaceted, involving rigorous assessment processes, strong governance frameworks, and adherence to established disclosure guidelines. This proactive stance not only helps mitigate potential risks but also positions the company as a responsible entity committed to sustainability and transparency in the face of climate change [Data: Entities (161); Relationships (3971, 3937)].","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

### Healthcare Initiatives

The 2023 Annual Report of Uni-President provides a comprehensive overview of the company's operations, including its commitment to anti-corruption policies and procedures. Specifically, the report outlines the frameworks established to prevent corruption and ensure ethical behavior among employees and stakeholders. This includes the implementation of anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies, which are integral to the company's ethical management practices [Data: Entities (543); Relationships (205, 706)].

## Evidence of Implementation

While the report details the existence of these policies, it also emphasizes the importance of communication and training regarding anti-corruption measures. The organization has made efforts to educate employees about these policies, which is a critical step in ensuring their effective implementation [Data: Entities (2535, 3941); Relationships (2411, 1734)]. 

However, the report does not explicitly provide specific cases addressed or outcomes achieved related to the implementation of these anti-corruption policies. It focuses more on the frameworks and commitments rather than detailing individual incidents or measurable outcomes. The emphasis is on the establishment of guidelines and the training provided to employees, which are essential for fostering a culture of integrity and ethical behavior within the organization [Data: Entities (238, 576); Relationships (2412, 2413)].

In summary, while the 2023 Annual Report discloses the anti-corruption policies and procedures and highlights the training efforts, it lacks detailed evidence of specific cases or outcomes achieved from these implementations.","#### **Anti-Corruption Policies and Implementation**
