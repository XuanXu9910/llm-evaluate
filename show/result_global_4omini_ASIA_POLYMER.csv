### Board Responsibilities

The Board of Directors is tasked with overseeing operations, compliance, and strategic direction, which includes a focus on sustainability initiatives. This oversight extends to receiving reports from the President and Senior Management concerning risk management and control measures, which encompass ESG considerations. This engagement suggests that the board is involved in governance related to ESG, but the reports do not provide metrics or specific information about the diversity of its members or their qualifications in ESG areas [Data: Reports (240, 142, 232, 243, 241)].

### ESG Committee Composition

Additionally, the reports mention the existence of an ESG Committee within the governance structure.
