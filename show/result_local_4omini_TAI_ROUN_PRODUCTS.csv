The ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) report primarily follows the **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)** standards, which are internationally recognized guidelines for sustainability reporting. The GRI provides a comprehensive framework that helps organizations disclose their economic, environmental, and social impacts, ensuring transparency and accountability in their sustainability practices [Data: Entities (34, 38, 991); Relationships (1434)].

In addition to GRI, the report may also align with other frameworks such as the **Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)** and the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**. However, specific references to SASB and TCFD are not provided in the available data, indicating that the primary focus is on GRI standards.

## Alignment with GRI Standards

The ESG report demonstrates a strong alignment with GRI standards through the incorporation of the **GRI Standards Index**, which serves as a framework for sustainability reporting. This index ensures that the disclosures made in the report are consistent with global standards, thereby enhancing the credibility and comparability of the information presented [Data: Relationships (2)].

Moreover, the report includes various **performance indicators** that are essential for measuring compliance with sustainability practices. These indicators are outlined in the regulations governing the preparation and filing of sustainability reports, further reinforcing the report's adherence to established guidelines [Data: Relationships (899, 901)].

## Conclusion

In summary, the ESG report primarily follows the GRI framework, which is widely recognized and respected internationally. The integration of the GRI Standards Index and adherence to performance indicators indicates a robust alignment with these frameworks, promoting transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting. While there may be potential alignment with SASB and TCFD, the data does not provide specific evidence of this, suggesting that GRI remains the focal point of the report's framework.","### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The ESG report of Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. adheres to internationally recognized frameworks to ensure the credibility and comprehensiveness of its sustainability disclosures. Specifically, the report follows:

1. **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards**:
   - The report is drafted in accordance with the GRI Standards issued by the Global Reporting Initiative, as highlighted in the editorial principles section. It adopts a core disclosure approach, focusing on material topics relevant to stakeholders and aligned with global sustainability practices.

2. **Third-Party Assurance**:
   - To enhance reliability, the report undergoes independent limited assurance by BDO Taiwan Union & Co. This assurance aligns with GAAP 3000 (""Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information""), which underscores its compliance with international assurance standards.

3. **ISO Standards**:
   - The company integrates ISO standards into its operations, including ISO 22000 for food safety management and ISO 9001 for quality management. These certifications reflect a commitment to internationally accepted operational and reporting practices.

---

### **Alignment with Frameworks**

#### **Strengths**:

1. **Robust Data Collection and Disclosure**:
   - Tairoun follows structured data collection and measurement methods aligned with GRI Standards, ensuring compliance with local regulations or, where applicable, international and industry-specific standards.

2. **Third-Party Verification**:
   - The engagement of an independent assurance provider reinforces the credibility of the report. By adhering to GAAP 3000, the company demonstrates its commitment to transparency and accountability.

3. **Integration of ISO Standards**:
   - The adoption of ISO standards, particularly in food safety and quality management, reflects a strong alignment with best practices in operational and sustainability management.

4. **Transparency in Material Issues**:
   - The report incorporates stakeholder concerns into its materiality assessment, guided by GRI’s material topics framework. This ensures a balanced approach to addressing economic, environmental, and social impacts.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Broader Framework Integration**:
   - While the report adheres to GRI Standards and ISO certifications, it does not explicitly reference frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) or the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Including these could enhance the report's relevance to global investors and climate-related risk disclosures.

2. **Clearer SDG Alignment**:
   - Although the company outlines its sustainable development strategies, a detailed mapping of contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would provide greater clarity and alignment with global sustainability agendas.

3. **Enhanced Assurance Scope**:
   - While third-party assurance is provided, extending its scope to cover more non-financial indicators would further enhance stakeholder confidence in the disclosed data.

---

### **Conclusion**

Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability reporting by adhering to GRI Standards, leveraging third-party assurance, and aligning its operational processes with ISO standards. However, the report could benefit from integrating additional internationally recognized frameworks like SASB and TCFD and providing detailed SDG mapping to enhance its global relevance and comprehensiveness.",0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.8580753429355723,0.935483870967742,0.61,0.7529846017432793

The organizational scope and time frame of the sustainability report are critical components that ensure clarity and transparency in reporting practices. According to the data, the regulations governing the preparation and filing of sustainability reports by listed companies emphasize the importance of clearly defining the scope of the report. This includes specifying the parts of the company that are included, such as subsidiaries and supply chains.

### Inclusion of Subsidiaries and Supply Chains

The sustainability reports are designed to encompass various aspects of the organization, including its subsidiaries. The data indicates that the company conducts greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories of its subsidiaries to assess their contributions to overall emissions [Data: Entities (595); Relationships (520)]. This practice highlights the company's commitment to transparency regarding its environmental impact across different operational segments.

Moreover, the regulations also guide the evaluation of suppliers in accordance with sustainability reporting requirements, ensuring that supply chain practices are included in the overall assessment [Data: Relationships (1029)]. This comprehensive approach allows stakeholders to understand the full scope of the company's sustainability efforts, including the environmental and social impacts associated with its supply chain.

### Conclusion

In summary, the organizational scope and time frame of the sustainability report are clearly defined, with specific references to the inclusion of subsidiaries and supply chains. This structured approach not only enhances the quality of the report but also fosters greater accountability and transparency in the company's sustainability practices [Data: Entities (186, 1083); Relationships (901, 600)].","### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

   - **Yunlin Plant**: Specializes in producing corn starch and high fructose syrup.
   - **Kaohsiung Plant**: Produces various feed products.

2. **Subsidiaries and Affiliates**:
   - The report briefly mentions that **Horoun Products Co., Ltd.** is included in consolidated financial statements. However, due to its minimal revenue contribution, its impact on the report’s scope is noted as insignificant.

3. **Exclusions**:
   - Joint ventures, subsidiaries, or leased facilities that do not significantly impact operations are excluded. This delineation is explicitly stated, reinforcing the focus on core operational entities.

4. **Supply Chain and External Boundaries**:
   - While the report emphasizes Tairoun’s direct operations, it mentions interactions with external supply chains, such as procurement of raw materials (e.g., corn, cassava starch), which undergo rigorous quality assurance checks but are not directly included in the operational scope.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Broader Supply Chain Inclusion**:
   - Although the report mentions raw material procurement, further detail on sustainability practices within the supply chain would enhance transparency.

2. **Explicit Subsidiary Reporting**:
   - While Horoun Products Co., Ltd. is mentioned, more detail about its sustainability impact or initiatives could provide a holistic view.

---

### **Conclusion**

The Tairoun ESG report demonstrates clear articulation of its organizational scope and time frame, focusing on core operations and maintaining transparency regarding exclusions. While the report is well-structured, incorporating more detailed insights into the supply chain and subsidiary operations could strengthen its comprehensiveness and stakeholder engagement.",1.0,0.0,0.7364931440695814,0.2,0.26,0.6764580445385198

Reporting

The available data indicates that the company, Tairoun Products Co., Ltd., is actively involved in monitoring and reporting its carbon emissions. Specifically, the company focuses on carbon emissions produced by its operations, which are categorized under greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the data does not explicitly mention the breakdown of emissions into Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 categories. Instead, it emphasizes the overall GHG emissions and the company's commitment to reducing its carbon footprint [Data: Entities (74, 1024); Relationships (345, 99)].

### Verification of Emissions Metrics

Regarding the verification of these emissions metrics, the data does not provide specific information about whether the carbon emissions reported by Tairoun are verified by third parties. The emphasis is primarily on the company's internal assessments and reporting practices, such as conducting GHG inventories to measure emissions from its subsidiaries [Data: Entities (593, 520); Relationships (518)]. 

### Conclusion

In summary, while Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. is engaged in monitoring its carbon emissions and has established practices for reporting, the specific quantifiable data on Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions is not detailed in the provided information. Additionally, there is no mention of third-party verification for these metrics. Further inquiry into the company's sustainability reports or external audits may be necessary to obtain this information.","### **Carbon Emissions Reporting**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** outlines the company’s commitment to environmental sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) management. However, while the report emphasizes energy conservation and emissions reduction measures, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of **Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions**. Below is a comprehensive evaluation based on the available data:

---

#### **Quantifiable Data on Carbon Emissions**

1. **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions**:
   - The report mentions the implementation of specific energy conservation measures, such as transitioning to **natural gas boilers** and utilizing **solar photovoltaic systems** at the Yunlin Plant, as part of its efforts to reduce direct and indirect emissions. However, no explicit quantifiable data is provided for Scope 1 (direct emissions) or Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy) in terms of metric tons of CO₂ equivalent.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions**:
   - There is no mention of Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect emissions across the value chain (e.g., raw material production, transportation, and end-of-life product handling).

3. **GHG Inventory and Reporting**:
   - The report states that Tairoun prepares annual **GHG inventory reports**, focusing on energy consumption and pollutant emissions. However, these inventories are not included in the report, and no specific numerical values or trends are disclosed.

---

#### **Verification of Metrics**

- The report highlights that its data collection and reporting methodologies comply with **local regulations** or, where not specified, international standards. However, while **BDO Taiwan Union & Co.** conducted limited third-party assurance for the report, it is unclear whether this assurance explicitly covered carbon emissions metrics.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

#### **Strengths**:
1. **Commitment to GHG Management**:
   - Actions such as adopting natural gas boilers and installing renewable energy systems demonstrate a proactive approach to emissions reduction.

2. **Integration with Sustainability Goals**:
   - The report aligns its energy conservation and emissions reduction efforts with broader goals, such as achieving **net zero emissions by 2050**.

#### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Lack of Quantifiable Emissions Data**:
   - The absence of specific numerical data for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions limits the report’s ability to provide a comprehensive view of its carbon footprint.

2. **Third-Party Verification Scope**:
   - While the report is assured by an external party, explicit confirmation of emissions verification would enhance credibility.

3. **Expanded Scope 3 Reporting**:
   - Including emissions from upstream and downstream activities would provide a more holistic assessment of the company’s environmental impact.

---

### **Conclusion**

The ESG report of Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. demonstrates a commitment to emissions reduction through specific initiatives and GHG inventory preparation. However, the lack of detailed, quantifiable data on Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, coupled with limited clarity on third-party verification of these metrics, represents a significant gap. To strengthen future reports, the company should disclose comprehensive emissions data, provide verification details, and expand the scope of its carbon footprint assessment to include Scope 3 emissions.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.51,0.8338313113995267

Targets

The report outlines emission reduction targets that aim for a 1% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions each year. This target is part of a broader commitment to environmental sustainability and reflects the company's dedication to addressing climate change. However, the data does not specify whether these targets are explicitly science-based or aligned with any recognized scientific frameworks, such as the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Therefore, it remains unclear if the targets are grounded in scientific consensus regarding the necessary reductions to limit global warming.

### Milestones and Deadlines

While the report mentions a yearly target of 1% reduction, it does not provide detailed milestones or specific deadlines beyond this annual goal. The absence of intermediate milestones could hinder the ability to track progress effectively. Effective tracking typically involves setting specific, measurable goals at various intervals, which can help in assessing whether the company is on track to meet its long-term objectives. The lack of such detailed milestones may limit transparency and accountability in the company's emission reduction efforts.

In summary, while the company has set a clear annual target for emission reductions, the lack of information regarding the scientific basis of these targets and the absence of detailed milestones may raise questions about the robustness and effectiveness of their emission reduction strategy [Data: Entities (596, 1024, 565, 299, 273); Relationships (522)].","### **Assessment of Emission Reduction Targets**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** outlines the company’s commitment to reducing emissions and achieving sustainability goals. However, the emission reduction targets described are not explicitly labeled as **science-based targets (SBTs)**, and while some milestones and deadlines are included, they lack comprehensive specificity. Below is a detailed evaluation:

---

#### **Emission Reduction Targets and Their Basis**

1. **Net Zero Emissions Goal**:
   - The report highlights Tairoun’s aim to achieve **net zero emissions by 2050**, aligning with global sustainability initiatives and Taiwan’s green energy development goals. This target reflects a long-term vision but does not explicitly refer to adherence to frameworks such as the **Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**, which ensures alignment with climate science.

2. **Renewable Energy Integration**:
   - Key initiatives, such as the installation of **solar photovoltaic systems** at the Yunlin Plant and the transition to natural gas boilers, are indicative of efforts to reduce direct emissions. However, these efforts are described in general terms without specifying how they contribute quantitatively to the net zero target.

3. **GHG Inventory Reporting**:
   - The company prepares annual **GHG inventory reports**, focusing on energy consumption and pollutant emissions. While this demonstrates awareness and monitoring, the absence of explicit Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emission reduction benchmarks limits the clarity of progress tracking.

---

#### **Milestones and Deadlines**

1. **Long-Term Deadline (2050)**:
   - The commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 provides a clear endpoint, aligning with global sustainability timelines. However, interim milestones that detail incremental reductions are not included in the report, making it challenging to assess progress.

2. **Operational Milestones**:
   - Some operational changes, such as the annual replacement of older equipment since 2016 and renewable energy installations, are described but lack accompanying quantitative milestones or deadlines for specific emission reductions.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

#### **Strengths**:
1. **Long-Term Vision**:
   - Setting a 2050 net zero target demonstrates alignment with global sustainability priorities and reflects a commitment to addressing climate change.
   
2. **Integration of Renewable Energy**:
   - Tangible actions, such as solar installations and fuel transitions, align with emission reduction objectives and indicate proactive steps toward achieving the goal.

3. **Awareness and Monitoring**:
   - The preparation of GHG inventory reports highlights an established foundation for emissions tracking.

#### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Science-Based Validation**:
   - Explicit alignment with science-based targets, such as those under the SBTi framework, would enhance the credibility and scientific rigor of the company’s emission reduction strategy.

2. **Interim Milestones**:
   - The inclusion of intermediate goals (e.g., 2030 targets) with specific percentage reductions in emissions would enable stakeholders to track progress effectively.

3. **Quantitative Tracking**:
   - Providing data on the anticipated and actual emission reductions from specific initiatives (e.g., natural gas boiler conversions or solar installations) would strengthen transparency.

4. **Scope 3 Inclusion**:
   - Expanding the targets to include Scope 3 emissions (e.g., supply chain and product lifecycle impacts) would provide a holistic view of the company’s carbon footprint.

---

### **Conclusion**

While Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. demonstrates a commitment to reducing emissions through its net zero by 2050 goal and operational energy conservation initiatives, the targets outlined in the report lack the specificity and science-based validation required for comprehensive progress tracking. The absence of interim milestones and quantitative reductions makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of the initiatives in achieving the stated goals. Incorporating science-based targets, measurable milestones, and detailed emissions tracking would significantly enhance the report's transparency and accountability.",0.15,0.0,0.0,0.7894736842105263,0.54,0.7487527459511892

Change Risks

The company employs a comprehensive approach to assess and disclose the financial and operational risks associated with climate change, including extreme weather events and regulatory changes. This process is integral to its risk management framework, which encompasses several key components.

### Risk Identification and Analysis

The first step in the company's risk management process is **risk identification**, where potential risks related to climate change are recognized. This includes evaluating the implications of extreme weather conditions and the financial impacts of regulatory changes on operations [Data: Entities (82, 313); Relationships (1084)]. Following identification, the company conducts **risk analysis** to assess the likelihood and potential impact of these risks, enabling informed decision-making [Data: Entities (321); Relationships (1085)].

### Risk Management Strategies

Once risks are identified and analyzed, the company implements **risk management strategies** aimed at mitigating these risks. This involves **risk control** measures designed to minimize the adverse effects of identified risks, ensuring that the organization can effectively manage potential threats [Data: Entities (316); Relationships (1086)]. Additionally, the company regularly conducts **risk reviews** to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies and make necessary adjustments [Data: Entities (325); Relationships (1089)].

### Regulatory Compliance and Reporting

The company is also committed to complying with regulations governing sustainability reporting. It prepares and files **Sustainability Reports** that disclose its performance indicators and sustainability practices, including how it addresses climate change risks [Data: Entities (186); Relationships (601)]. These reports are essential for transparency and accountability, providing stakeholders with insights into the company's risk management efforts related to climate change [Data: Entities (996); Relationships (894)].

### Conclusion

In summary, the company systematically identifies, analyzes, and manages the risks posed by climate change through a structured risk management framework. By adhering to regulatory requirements and maintaining transparency in its sustainability reporting, the company ensures that stakeholders are informed about its strategies to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of climate change [Data: Entities (1083, 1119); Relationships (901, 900)]. This proactive approach not only safeguards the company's operations but also aligns with broader sustainability goals.","### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** addresses climate change as a significant environmental and operational challenge. While the report demonstrates awareness of potential risks and highlights related mitigation strategies, it provides limited information on the detailed assessment or quantitative disclosure of financial and operational risks posed by climate change.

1. **Physical Risks**:
   - The report acknowledges the impact of climate change on operational stability, particularly concerning resource availability. For instance:
     - It identifies **extreme weather events** as potential disruptors to the supply chain and production processes.
     - Concerns regarding **water resource availability**, vital for the company’s manufacturing operations, are explicitly mentioned, with a focus on adapting operations to mitigate these risks.

2. **Transitional Risks**:
   - Tairoun recognizes the potential impact of **regulatory changes** on its business. For example:
     - Compliance with evolving environmental regulations, including energy efficiency and emissions reduction mandates, is identified as a critical aspect of its risk management strategy.
     - The company is actively transitioning to low-carbon operations, such as shifting to **natural gas boilers** and **solar photovoltaic systems**, to align with regulatory expectations.

---

#### **Disclosure of Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Risk Assessment Framework**:
   - While the report highlights awareness of climate-related risks, it does not provide a structured framework or methodology, such as alignment with the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**, for assessing and categorizing these risks.

2. **Operational Mitigation Efforts**:
   - Specific actions taken to address operational risks include:
     - **Energy Transition**: The use of natural gas and renewable energy sources to reduce carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.
     - **Resource Efficiency**: Measures to optimize resource utilization and reduce waste, thereby enhancing resilience against regulatory and environmental pressures.

3. **Financial Impact Analysis**:
   - The report does not include quantitative disclosures of the financial impact of climate-related risks. For instance:
     - There are no assessments of the potential costs associated with extreme weather events, regulatory penalties, or required infrastructure adaptations.
     - Financial risks related to supply chain disruptions or raw material shortages due to climate variability are not quantified.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

#### **Strengths**:
1. **Proactive Mitigation Strategies**:
   - The company’s focus on renewable energy adoption and resource efficiency demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to reducing climate-related operational risks.
   
2. **Regulatory Awareness**:
   - The acknowledgment of evolving environmental regulations and the implementation of compliance measures reflect a commitment to risk management.

3. **Integration of Climate Considerations**:
   - Linking climate change risks to operational priorities, such as energy efficiency and water resource management, ensures that sustainability is embedded in business decisions.

#### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Structured Risk Assessment**:
   - Introducing a systematic framework, such as TCFD, to evaluate and disclose climate-related risks would provide a clearer understanding of their scope and materiality.

2. **Quantitative Analysis**:
   - The report should include specific data on the financial and operational impacts of climate change, such as estimated costs from extreme weather events or compliance-related expenditures.

3. **Scenario Planning**:
   - Developing and disclosing climate scenario analyses would enhance stakeholders’ ability to assess the company’s preparedness for various climate-related contingencies.

4. **Value Chain Considerations**:
   - Expanding the analysis to include downstream and upstream risks, such as those faced by suppliers and customers, would provide a more comprehensive risk profile.

---

### **Conclusion**

Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. demonstrates an understanding of climate-related risks and outlines proactive measures to mitigate their operational impacts. However, the report lacks a structured framework for assessing and disclosing the financial implications of these risks. By adopting a recognized standard, such as TCFD, and providing quantitative analyses of risk scenarios and financial impacts, the company can significantly enhance the transparency and comprehensiveness of its climate risk disclosures. This would enable stakeholders to better evaluate its resilience and preparedness in the face of climate change challenges.",0.75,0.0,0.8976337282549359,0.5483870967741935,0.32,0.7460441515386835

Overview of ESG Oversight in the Company

The company has established a robust governance structure that integrates sustainability efforts into its overall corporate governance framework. While the data does not explicitly mention a dedicated ESG committee, the roles and responsibilities related to sustainability are clearly defined within the existing governance structures.

### Leadership and Governance Structure

The **Chairman** of the Board of Directors plays a pivotal role in overseeing the company's sustainability initiatives, including the creation and publication of the Sustainability Report. This report is essential for communicating the company's commitment to sustainability and ensuring transparency in its environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices [Data: Relationships (0, 1, 12); Entities (1, 186)].

The **General Manager** is also significantly involved in sustainability governance. This role includes overseeing the management department, which is responsible for tracking performance related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) issues and ensuring that relevant information is disclosed in sustainability reports. The General Manager's leadership is crucial for integrating sustainability into the company's operational strategies [Data: Relationships (828, 359, 20); Entities (129)].

### Integration of Sustainability into Governance

The company's governance structure emphasizes accountability and transparency, which are critical for effective sustainability management. The **Board of Directors** is responsible for overseeing governance practices, including sustainability reporting, and has incorporated independent directors to enhance diversity and oversight [Data: Relationships (394, 412); Entities (2, 994)].

Moreover, the company has established **Corporate Sustainable Development Goals** that guide its sustainability efforts. These goals are detailed in the Sustainability Report, which outlines the company's strategies and performance indicators related to sustainability practices [Data: Relationships (12, 19); Entities (12, 0)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while there may not be a dedicated ESG committee explicitly mentioned, the company's governance structure effectively integrates sustainability oversight through the roles of the Chairman, General Manager, and the Board of Directors. This integration ensures that sustainability efforts are aligned with corporate governance principles, promoting accountability and transparency in the company's operations [Data: Relationships (1, 20, 21); Entities (2, 186)].","### **ESG Governance and Leadership**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** provides details on the company’s governance structure and the integration of sustainability efforts into its operational framework. Below is an analysis of the extent to which the company demonstrates leadership and accountability in managing ESG initiatives.

---

#### **Governance Structure for ESG Oversight**

1. **Board of Directors**:
   - Tairoun’s governance framework is anchored by a Board of Directors comprising 13 members, including three independent directors. In 2023, the Board convened six times with a director attendance rate of 97%, indicating active involvement in oversight responsibilities.

2. **Delegation of Responsibility**:
   - While Tairoun has not established a dedicated ESG or Corporate Sustainability Committee, sustainability management is decentralized across departments. The Management Department acts as the coordinating body, consolidating evaluations and implementations from respective operational units. Relevant issues are reported to the General Manager during project meetings and subsequently disclosed in the sustainability report in alignment with GRI Standards.

3. **Functional Committees**:
   - The company has established specialized committees such as the Audit and Remuneration Committees to manage aspects like financial reporting, internal controls, and performance evaluation of senior executives. However, ESG-specific responsibilities are not explicitly assigned to these committees.

---

#### **Integration of Sustainability into Governance**

1. **Materiality Analysis**:
   - The company has adopted a structured process to identify material issues that impact stakeholders and its operations. This analysis encompasses environmental, social, and governance dimensions and informs the strategic alignment of sustainability efforts with long-term goals.

2. **Operational Oversight**:
   - Sustainability initiatives are monitored at the departmental level, ensuring accountability. Departments such as the Management Department play a pivotal role in legal compliance, labor safety, and health initiatives, among other responsibilities.

3. **Ethical Corporate Management**:
   - Tairoun’s governance includes a ""Code of Ethical Conduct"" and ""Ethical Corporate Management Best Practice Principles"" approved by the Board. These policies aim to enhance corporate transparency, promote ethical behavior, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

##### **Strengths**:
1. **Well-Defined Governance Framework**:
   - The presence of independent directors and functional committees enhances oversight and aligns governance practices with regulatory expectations.
   
2. **Transparency in Reporting**:
   - The integration of material issues into the sustainability report and disclosure of Board activities demonstrate transparency and accountability.

##### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Dedicated ESG Committee**:
   - Establishing a dedicated ESG or Sustainability Committee at the executive level would centralize oversight and ensure consistent management of ESG priorities.

2. **Explicit Role Assignments**:
   - While sustainability efforts are decentralized, defining explicit responsibilities for ESG governance within the Board or committees could enhance strategic focus and decision-making.

---

### **Conclusion**

Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. has made significant strides in integrating sustainability into its governance structure. The company’s approach to delegating responsibilities across departments and the coordination role of the Management Department reflects a commitment to embedding ESG principles in operations. However, the establishment of a dedicated ESG committee or the inclusion of ESG oversight as a key function of an existing committee would enhance its governance structure. These measures would ensure a more centralized and effective approach to managing its sustainability agenda.",0.9411764705882352,0.1999999998,0.7684981698962966,1.0,0.36,0.7269961310500044
