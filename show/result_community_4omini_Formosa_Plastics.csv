The **2023 Sustainability Report of Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC)** provides detailed and quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions, covering Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However, there is no explicit mention of Scope 3 emissions in the report. Below is an analysis of the available information:

---

#### **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions**

1. **Quantifiable Metrics:**  
   - FPC reports that its **Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions for 2023 totaled 8.005 million tons of CO₂e**.  
   - This reflects a **7.3% absolute reduction** compared to the baseline year of 2020, equating to a reduction of 630,000 tons of CO₂e.  
   - Emissions intensity also shows improvement, declining from **6,205.40 tons CO₂e/NT$100 million** in 2020 to **5,324.22 tons CO₂e/NT$100 million** in 2023, a 14.2% improvement in efficiency.

2. **Reduction Targets:**  
   - FPC has set a clear target for reducing its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, aiming for a **20% reduction by 2025** and **40% reduction by 2030**, relative to 2020 levels.  
   - The company has also committed to achieving **carbon neutrality by 2050**, integrating this goal into its energy transition and operational strategies.

3. **Verification:**  
   - The reported data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions has been **independently verified by the British Standards Institution (BSI)** under the AA1000AS v3 assurance framework. This enhances the credibility and transparency of the metrics.

---

#### **Scope 3 Emissions**

- The report does not provide specific data or quantifiable metrics for Scope 3 emissions. While Scope 3 emissions typically represent a significant portion of a company's carbon footprint, their absence limits the comprehensiveness of FPC’s carbon disclosures.  
- The company may benefit from future disclosures that include Scope 3 emissions, covering upstream and downstream activities such as purchased goods, transportation, and product use.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- **Detailed Quantitative Reporting:** The inclusion of absolute and intensity metrics for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions demonstrates transparency and a commitment to measurable improvements.  
- **Clear Targets:** Long-term reduction goals (2030 and 2050) are well-defined and consistent with global sustainability benchmarks.  
- **Third-Party Verification:** Independent assurance from BSI adds credibility to the reported data.

**Improvement Areas:**
- **Inclusion of Scope 3 Emissions:** Expanding the scope of carbon reporting to include Scope 3 emissions would provide a more comprehensive view of the company’s carbon footprint.  
- **Breakdown of Emissions by Source:** A more granular breakdown of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (e.g., by operational activity or facility) would enhance stakeholder understanding.  

---

#### **Conclusion**

FPC provides robust and transparent data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, supported by third-party verification, and demonstrates measurable progress toward reduction targets. However, the absence of Scope 3 emissions data represents an area for future improvement, which would enhance the comprehensiveness of the company’s carbon footprint analysis.
