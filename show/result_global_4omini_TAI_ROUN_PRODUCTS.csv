The report indicates that Tairoun is committed to measuring and reporting its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity and reduction efforts over the past three years. This structured approach suggests a proactive stance towards emissions management. However, the report does not clarify whether these targets are science-based, which is a critical aspect for ensuring that the targets align with global climate goals.

### Lack of Specificity in Targets

While Tairoun adheres to government regulations that require the conduct of GHG inventories and emissions management, the details regarding the science-based nature of the targets remain unspecified. Furthermore, the report does not mention the presence of specific milestones or deadlines that would facilitate effective tracking of progress. This absence of clear benchmarks may hinder the ability to assess the effectiveness of Tairoun's emissions reduction efforts over time [Data: Reports (92)].

### Implications

The lack of science-based targets and specific milestones may imply that Tairoun's emissions reduction strategy could benefit from further refinement. Establishing science-based targets and clear timelines would not only enhance accountability but also align the company's efforts with broader climate initiatives. Without these elements, it may be challenging to gauge the true impact of Tairoun's emissions management practices.

In summary, while Tairoun demonstrates a commitment to emissions management, the report does not provide sufficient information to confirm whether the emission reduction targets are science-based or if they include the necessary milestones and deadlines for effective progress tracking.","### **Assessment of Emission Reduction Targets**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** outlines the company’s commitment to reducing emissions and achieving sustainability goals. However, the emission reduction targets described are not explicitly labeled as **science-based targets (SBTs)**, and while some milestones and deadlines are included, they lack comprehensive specificity. Below is a detailed evaluation:

---

#### **Emission Reduction Targets and Their Basis**

1. **Net Zero Emissions Goal**:
   - The report highlights Tairoun’s aim to achieve **net zero emissions by 2050**, aligning with global sustainability initiatives and Taiwan’s green energy development goals. This target reflects a long-term vision but does not explicitly refer to adherence to frameworks such as the **Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**, which ensures alignment with climate science.

2. **Renewable Energy Integration**:
   - Key initiatives, such as the installation of **solar photovoltaic systems** at the Yunlin Plant and the transition to natural gas boilers, are indicative of efforts to reduce direct emissions. However, these efforts are described in general terms without specifying how they contribute quantitatively to the net zero target.

3. **GHG Inventory Reporting**:
   - The company prepares annual **GHG inventory reports**, focusing on energy consumption and pollutant emissions. While this demonstrates awareness and monitoring, the absence of explicit Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emission reduction benchmarks limits the clarity of progress tracking.

---

#### **Milestones and Deadlines**

1. **Long-Term Deadline (2050)**:
   - The commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 provides a clear endpoint, aligning with global sustainability timelines. However, interim milestones that detail incremental reductions are not included in the report, making it challenging to assess progress.
