The ESG report adheres to several internationally recognized frameworks that guide organizations in sustainability reporting. The primary frameworks utilized include:

1. **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)**: The GRI Standards are global guidelines designed for sustainability reporting, enabling organizations to disclose their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. AGV follows these standards for general disclosures in its sustainability reporting, ensuring a comprehensive approach to reporting on sustainability impacts [Data: Entities (287); Relationships (4, 141)].

2. **Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)**: SASB develops and maintains sustainability accounting standards tailored for various industries, including the processed foods sector. AGV considers SASB standards in its sustainability reporting process, which helps ensure that the organization addresses critical sustainability issues relevant to its operations [Data: Entities (62, 286); Relationships (142)].

3. **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**: The TCFD provides a framework for companies to disclose climate-related financial risks. The GRI framework is aligned with TCFD principles, enhancing the comprehensiveness of climate-related disclosures in AGV's reporting [Data: Entities (61); Relationships (856)].

## Alignment with Frameworks

AGV's ESG report demonstrates a strong alignment with these frameworks. The organization adheres to GRI standards, which serve as a comprehensive framework for reporting on material topics, including economic performance, environmental management, and social impacts. This alignment is crucial for promoting transparency and accountability in sustainability practices [Data: Entities (53, 2239); Relationships (648)].

Additionally, the integration of SASB standards ensures that AGV's reporting is industry-specific, addressing the unique sustainability challenges faced by the processed foods sector. This tailored approach enhances the relevance and effectiveness of the ESG report [Data: Relationships (777, 774)].

Furthermore, the incorporation of TCFD principles into the GRI framework allows AGV to provide detailed disclosures regarding climate-related risks, which is increasingly important for stakeholders seeking to understand the organization's resilience to climate change [Data: Relationships (856)].

In summary, AGV's ESG report is well-structured and aligns with internationally recognized frameworks such as GRI, SASB, and TCFD. This alignment not only enhances the credibility of the report but also ensures that AGV effectively communicates its sustainability performance and commitments to stakeholders [Data: Relationships (4, 141, 142)].","#### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The organizational scope and time frame of the report are indeed clearly defined. The report pertains to the period from January 1 to December 31, 2023, which marks the specific duration for which the data presented in the Sustainability Report is relevant [Data: Entities (68); Relationships (821)].

### Inclusion of Company Parts

Regarding the inclusion of various parts of the company, the report specifies that AGV has various subsidiaries involved in its corporate activities. However, it is important to note that some subsidiaries are excluded from the reporting scope based on operational control. Additionally, there are subsidiaries established specifically for investment or tax purposes that are also not included in the reporting [Data: Entities (58, 59); Relationships (10, 11)]. 

Furthermore, the report addresses Scope 3 emissions, which encompass indirect emissions occurring in the value chain of the reporting company, including those from suppliers and end-users. This highlights the broader environmental impact of AGV's activities beyond its direct operations [Data: Entities (1745, 1757); Relationships (691)].

In summary, the report provides a clear time frame and outlines the organizational scope, including the specific parts of the company that are included or excluded from the reporting. This clarity is essential for stakeholders to understand the context and limitations of the sustainability data presented.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The ESG report of AGV Products Corporation clearly defines its organizational scope and time frame, adhering to standard disclosure practices to ensure transparency and stakeholder clarity. 

---

#### **Time Frame**

The report encompasses the reporting period of January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. This is explicitly stated in the ""Boundaries and Scope of Reporting"" section, ensuring readers understand the temporal context of the data and disclosures. The report also highlights that it is issued annually, with the current edition released in August 2024. This regularity underscores AGV’s commitment to consistent sustainability reporting.

---

#### **Organizational Scope**

The report specifies that its content focuses on AGV’s headquarters, excluding:

1. **Non-TWSE/TPEx-Listed Subsidiaries:** These subsidiaries are excluded due to their lack of operational control by AGV.
2. **Investment or Tax Purposes Subsidiaries:** Entities established solely for investment or tax-related purposes are outside the report’s scope.
3. **Subsidiaries Without Operational Control:** Entities over which AGV does not have direct operational oversight are also excluded.

The scope of the report aligns with AGV’s annual report for the same time period (January 1 to December 31, 2023), ensuring consistency in financial and non-financial disclosures.

---

#### **Clarity in Reporting Boundaries**

To provide further transparency, the report adheres to the GRI materiality principle, using stringent standards for data collection and verification. Additionally, any instances where data or scope deviate from the annual report are explicitly stated within the ESG report, minimizing ambiguity.

---

#### **Strengths in Defining Scope**

1. **Consistency:** The report aligns its scope with AGV’s annual financial reporting, ensuring stakeholders can easily correlate ESG and financial data.
2. **Transparency:** Clear exclusions (e.g., subsidiaries established for investment purposes) are documented, preventing potential misinterpretations.
3. **Verification:** The inclusion of third-party assurance from Crowe Taiwan enhances the credibility of the scope and boundaries defined in the report.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Supply Chain Inclusion:** While the report provides insights into supplier management, it could further detail how the ESG performance of the supply chain is integrated into the broader organizational scope.
2. **Subsidiary Reporting:** Including at least an overview or high-level performance summary of excluded subsidiaries would offer a more comprehensive picture.

The company's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives are intricately linked to its overall business strategy, reflecting a commitment to sustainable practices that enhance long-term economic performance. The Company prioritizes sustainable economic practices, which are embedded in its operational decisions and stakeholder interactions. This alignment is evident in the establishment of ethical corporate management regulations and a whistleblower reporting system aimed at preventing unethical behavior, including corruption and fraud [Data: Entities (406)].

### Clear Articulation of Connections

The connections between ESG initiatives and business strategy are articulated through various governance structures, including the Audit Committee, Board of Directors, and Remuneration Committee. These bodies focus on maintaining financial integrity and employee remuneration, ensuring that sustainability is not just a peripheral concern but a core aspect of the company's operational framework [Data: Relationships (927, 1511, 1512)]. 

Moreover, the company is actively involved in sustainability reporting, which serves as a platform to disclose its ESG performance and impacts. The Sustainability Report prepared by AGV Products Corporation outlines its corporate social responsibility and sustainability practices, detailing metrics and performance across environmental, social, and governance factors [Data: Entities (45, 2239)]. This report is crucial for identifying and analyzing material topics based on stakeholder communication, thereby reinforcing the connection between ESG initiatives and business strategy.

### Actionable Connections

The actionable nature of these connections is further emphasized through specific initiatives such as the beach cleanup program, which promotes environmental sustainability and encourages employee participation [Data: Relationships (1527)]. Additionally, the company plans to conduct a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory in 2024 and implement the ISO 50001 energy management system by 2025, demonstrating a proactive approach to managing its environmental impact [Data: Relationships (688, 1520)].

Furthermore, the establishment of the ESG Task Force indicates a structured approach to developing and implementing ESG policies and guidelines, ensuring that these initiatives are not only articulated but also actionable within the company's strategic framework [Data: Entities (751)]. 

In summary, the report clearly articulates the connections between the company's ESG initiatives and its overall business strategy, presenting them as actionable commitments that are integral to its operational success and sustainability goals. This alignment not only enhances the company's reputation but also positions it favorably in a market increasingly focused on responsible business practices.","#### **Linkage Between ESG Initiatives and Business Strategy**

The sustainability report prepared by AGV Products Corporation for the year 2023 does indeed focus on the company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. However, the specific details regarding the comparison of current ESG performance data with historical data are not explicitly mentioned in the provided data tables. The report serves as a comprehensive overview of AGV's sustainability practices and metrics for the reporting period, but it does not clarify whether it includes historical comparisons to highlight progress or trends over time.

### Transparency and Meaningfulness

While the report aims to provide transparency regarding AGV's sustainability efforts, the lack of explicit references to historical data comparisons raises questions about the meaningfulness of the reported metrics. Transparency in sustainability reporting is crucial for stakeholders to understand the organization's progress and the effectiveness of its initiatives. The report outlines AGV's commitment to sustainability and its adherence to GRI standards, which emphasize the importance of clear and accountable reporting practices [Data: Entities (45, 2239); Relationships (4, 141, 617)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while AGV's sustainability report is designed to communicate its ESG performance, the absence of specific historical data comparisons limits the ability to assess progress or trends effectively. For stakeholders, meaningful comparisons are essential to evaluate the company's sustainability trajectory and the impact of its initiatives over time. Further details on historical performance metrics would enhance the report's transparency and provide a clearer picture of AGV's sustainability journey.","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance Data with Historical Data**

The ESG report of AGV Products Corporation provides a structured and transparent overview of its current ESG performance. While it adheres to recognized frameworks such as GRI and TCFD, the report also attempts to highlight progress by incorporating comparisons with historical data in select areas. However, the extent and clarity of these comparisons vary.

---

#### **Progress Highlighted Through Historical Data**

1. **Environmental Performance:**
   - The report includes data on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy consumption, and waste management. For instance, it outlines progress in carbon emission reduction efforts and energy efficiency projects. While specific numerical comparisons with previous years are mentioned, the report would benefit from more consistent trend visualization, such as multi-year graphs or tables.

2. **Economic Performance:**
   - Economic indicators, such as annual revenue and production volumes, are presented alongside historical benchmarks. This provides stakeholders with insight into the company’s financial stability and growth in relation to its ESG efforts.

3. **Employee Welfare and Social Engagement:**
   - AGV details its initiatives related to employee care, welfare, and career development, such as training hours and welfare benefits. While these are outlined in narrative form, historical data to quantitatively compare year-over-year improvements is less prominent.

---

#### **Strengths of Historical Comparisons**

1. **Transparency:**
   - The report discloses key performance metrics related to emissions and energy, aligning with TCFD and GRI standards. This provides stakeholders with a clear understanding of AGV’s environmental footprint and progress toward sustainability goals.

2. **Materiality and Relevance:**
   - By focusing on material issues such as GHG emissions and energy consumption, the report aligns historical data comparisons with stakeholder priorities.

---

#### **Limitations and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Limited Scope of Historical Data:**
   - While the report does compare some current data to previous periods, the scope is not comprehensive across all ESG dimensions. For example, metrics on water use, waste management, and social impact could benefit from multi-year comparisons.

2. **Lack of Trend Visualization:**
   - The report could enhance its transparency by including visual aids, such as charts or graphs, to represent trends over multiple years. This would make comparisons more intuitive and accessible to stakeholders.

3. **Benchmarking:**
   - The absence of comparisons with industry standards or peer performance makes it challenging to contextualize AGV’s progress relative to its competitors.

---

#### **Recommendations**

1. **Incorporate Multi-Year Trends:**
   - AGV should consider including at least three years of data for key ESG metrics to highlight trends more effectively.

2. **Enhance Visualization:**
   - Adding graphs and charts for historical comparisons would improve readability and stakeholder engagement.

3. **Broaden Historical Data Coverage:**
   - Expanding historical data across additional ESG areas, such as water resource management and employee training metrics, would provide a more comprehensive picture of progress.

4. **Introduce Industry Benchmarking:**
   - Including comparisons with industry averages or best practices would contextualize AGV’s ESG performance within the broader market.

---

#### **Conclusion**

The ESG report of AGV Products Corporation demonstrates a commitment to tracking and disclosing performance over time. While some areas, such as environmental and economic performance, include historical data comparisons, there is room for improvement in the scope and visualization of these comparisons. By expanding its historical data coverage and enhancing trend representation, AGV could further strengthen the transparency and meaningfulness of its ESG disclosures.",1.0,0.0952380951927437,0.0,1.0,0.49,0.845928027846722

The company employs a comprehensive approach to assess and disclose the financial and operational risks associated with climate change, particularly focusing on extreme weather events and regulatory changes. This process is integral to its risk management framework and involves several key strategies.

### Risk Management Framework

The company integrates climate risk processes into its overall risk management system, which is designed to mitigate financial impacts stemming from climate-related challenges. This includes evaluating the resilience of its operations against various climate scenarios through scenario analysis, which helps in understanding potential financial implications [Data: Relationships (1530, 1531); Entities (2232)]. 

### Transition Plans and Adaptation Strategies

To manage climate-related risks effectively, the company has developed a transition plan that outlines specific strategies and targets for addressing both physical and transitional risks associated with climate change. This plan is crucial for adapting to the evolving regulatory landscape and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events [Data: Relationships (1528, 1529, 1532); Entities (2233)]. 

Additionally, the company emphasizes the importance of adaptation to climate change risks, which involves adjusting practices and policies to mitigate adverse impacts on its operations and financial performance [Data: Relationships (673); Entities (24)]. 

### Disclosure Practices

In terms of disclosure, the company follows the guidelines set forth by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which provides a framework for companies to report on climate-related financial risks. This alignment with TCFD recommendations enhances transparency and informs stakeholders about the financial implications of climate change [Data: Relationships (2290); Entities (1640)]. 

Furthermore, the company actively engages in initiatives to disclose climate-related information, ensuring that stakeholders are aware of the potential risks and the measures being taken to address them [Data: Entities (47)]. 

### Conclusion

In summary, the company's approach to assessing and disclosing climate change risks is multifaceted, involving a robust risk management framework, strategic transition plans, and adherence to established disclosure guidelines. This comprehensive strategy not only helps in mitigating risks but also promotes transparency and accountability in its operations, ultimately supporting sustainable business practices [Data: Relationships (1528, 1529, 1530); Entities (61, 1640)].","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

This tool is utilized to assess suppliers' adherence to various labor and human rights standards, ensuring that they meet the necessary criteria related to social responsibility [Data: Entities (1258), Relationships (582)]. The checklist serves as a means to evaluate suppliers' compliance with ethical practices, thereby promoting accountability within the supply chain [Data: Relationships (1951)].

Additionally, the company requires suppliers to sign the **Social Responsibility Commitments for Suppliers**, which formalizes their commitment to uphold specific social responsibility criteria, including compliance with labor laws and the prohibition of child labor and forced labor [Data: Entities (1257), Relationships (369)]. This commitment is essential for maintaining the company's standards and ensuring that suppliers engage in ethical practices throughout their operations [Data: Relationships (1224)].

### Evaluation and Reporting

The company conducts regular evaluations of suppliers to determine their compliance with social responsibility standards, with the results documented in **Evaluation Results** reports [Data: Entities (1456), Relationships (1949)]. These evaluations are crucial for identifying any potential violations and ensuring that corrective actions are taken when necessary.

In summary, the company has implemented a robust system of policies, audits, and compliance checks to safeguard human rights and ensure fair labor practices across its operations and supply chain. This commitment reflects the organization's dedication to ethical management and social responsibility [Data: Entities (406), 320)].","#### **Evaluation of Measures to Safeguard Human Rights**

The report provides insights into the structure of the Board of Directors, emphasizing its role in governance and oversight of the organization. The Board is composed of elected directors who are responsible for making strategic decisions and ensuring compliance with regulations. Notably, the inclusion of independent directors is highlighted, which is crucial for maintaining unbiased governance and oversight [Data: Relationships (922, 927, 914, 946, 917)].

### Diversity and ESG Expertise

In terms of diversity, the report mentions the representation of various demographic groups within the governance bodies and employees, indicating a commitment to inclusivity [Data: Entities (2144)]. However, specific details regarding the diversity metrics or the demographic breakdown of the Board members are not explicitly provided in the available data.

Regarding ESG-related expertise, the Board of Directors is tasked with overseeing the implementation of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives. The Board reviews sustainability reports and evaluates the organization's performance in these areas, ensuring that ESG considerations are integrated into the strategic direction of the company [Data: Relationships (175, 2060, 2514)]. This oversight is essential for aligning the company's operations with its sustainability goals and commitments.

### Conclusion

While the report outlines the governance structure and the role of the Board of Directors in overseeing ESG initiatives, it lacks detailed metrics on the diversity of its members. The emphasis on independent directors and the Board's involvement in ESG-related activities reflects a commitment to ethical governance and sustainability, but further information on demographic diversity would enhance the understanding of the Board's composition.","#### **Evaluation of the Board of Directors’ Structure**

These aspects are detailed in the ESG report, highlighting the company’s efforts to integrate ESG-related expertise into its highest decision-making body.

---

#### **Composition and Structure**

1. **Size and Composition:**
   - The Board of Directors consists of nine members, including three independent directors, which meets the company’s internal requirement for at least one-third of the board being independent. This composition is designed to ensure impartiality and a balance of perspectives.

2. **Diversity and Expertise:**

---

#### **Diversity Considerations**

   - The board includes directors aged 50-60 and those over 60, reflecting generational diversity. However, gender representation appears to be less emphasized, as all current board members are male.

2. **Commitment to Increasing Diversity:**
   - While the report does not explicitly highlight gender or minority inclusion goals, the focus on diverse professional expertise suggests a foundational approach to broadening diversity criteria in the future.

---

#### **ESG-Related Expertise**

1. **Continuous Training Programs:**
   - Directors participate in ongoing training on topics such as corporate governance, ESG principles, and emerging trends like carbon trading and green energy innovation. In 2023, directors averaged at least six hours of training each, ensuring they remain informed on sustainability and governance issues.

2. **Role of the President and ESG Task Force:**
   - The President, who also serves as the chief coordinator of the Sustainable Development Task Force, oversees the development and implementation of ESG policies. This integration reinforces the board’s commitment to sustainability at the executive level.

---

#### **Governance Practices**

1. **Nomination and Election Process:**
   - AGV follows a formal nomination process aligned with Article 192-1 of the Company Act, ensuring transparency and adherence to governance principles. Candidates are evaluated for their qualifications, and final selections are made during shareholder meetings.

2. **Performance Evaluations:**
   - The Board conducts annual self-evaluations covering participation, decision-making quality, and internal control. These evaluations include indicators for both collective and individual performance, fostering accountability.

---

#### **Strengths**

2. **Commitment to Training:**
   - Regular ESG-related training ensures that directors remain informed and capable of addressing sustainability challenges.

3. **Transparent Processes:**
   - A well-documented nomination and evaluation process enhances trust and accountability within the governance framework.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Gender and Ethnic Diversity:**
   - Increasing representation of women and other underrepresented groups would strengthen the board’s inclusivity.

2. **Explicit ESG Expertise:**
   - While training programs address ESG issues, including members with direct ESG or sustainability expertise would further enhance decision-making.

---

#### **Recommendations**

1. **Develop a Diversity Policy:**
   - Establish clear targets for gender and minority representation on the board to reflect broader stakeholder diversity.

2. **Expand ESG Expertise:**
   - Consider appointing directors with a background in environmental science, social responsibility, or governance practices to deepen ESG integration.

3. **Enhance Public Reporting:**
   - Provide more detailed disclosures on how diversity and ESG expertise impact board decision-making and company performance.

---

#### **Conclusion**

AGV Products Corporation has a robust board governance structure emphasizing professional expertise and accountability. By addressing gaps in gender diversity and explicitly integrating ESG expertise, the company can further enhance its leadership’s effectiveness and alignment with global governance standards.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.34,0.7601524423655962

The report does indeed disclose anti-corruption policies and procedures, particularly through the framework established by AGV known as the Anti-Corruption System. This system is designed to guide employees in ethical behavior and compliance with regulations, ensuring that the organization maintains a commitment to transparency and accountability in its operations [Data: Entities (1212); Relationships (1515)].

### Evidence of Implementation

In terms of evidence of implementation, the report includes specific metrics under the GRI 205 framework, which focuses on anti-corruption measures. For instance, GRI 205-1 emphasizes communication and training about anti-corruption policies, while GRI 205-2 reports confirmed incidents of corruption and the actions taken in response to those incidents [Data: Entities (2110, 2111); Relationships (2538, 2539)]. 

Additionally, the report outlines the process of investigations triggered by whistleblower reports, which serve as a mechanism for addressing misconduct. The Company conducts investigations to verify claims made by whistleblowers, thereby demonstrating a proactive approach to handling allegations of corruption [Data: Entities (1236); Relationships (1932, 1519)]. 

### Outcomes Achieved

While the report provides a framework for anti-corruption measures and details the processes in place, it does not specify the outcomes achieved in terms of resolved cases or the effectiveness of the implemented policies. However, the existence of a structured reporting system and the involvement of the Human Resources Department in managing these reports indicate a commitment to addressing unethical behavior [Data: Entities (1230); Relationships (1651)].

In summary, the report does disclose anti-corruption policies and procedures, and it provides evidence of their implementation through metrics and the investigation process. However, it lacks detailed outcomes regarding specific cases addressed or the overall effectiveness of these measures.","#### **Evaluation of Anti-Corruption Policies and Implementation**
