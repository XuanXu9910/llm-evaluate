The 2023 Sustainability Report of Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. provides a clear and comprehensive definition of its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring transparency and precision in its disclosures.

#### **Time Frame**
The report explicitly states that it covers the period from **January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023**, encompassing a full calendar year of the company’s operations. It also notes that the report is part of an annual sustainability reporting cycle, with previous issues released in June 2023 and the current report scheduled for release in June 2024. Future reports are planned for release in August annually, ensuring consistency and continuity in disclosure.

#### **Organizational Scope**
The report defines its organizational boundaries to include:
1. **Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. (Parent Company):** The main entity responsible for the overall operations and sustainability initiatives.
2. **Subsidiaries:** 
   - Fwusow Hsin Industry (Fwusow Hsin)
   - Charming Food
   - Won Gee Sheng Agricultural Technology Co., Ltd. (Won Gee Sheng)
   
   These subsidiaries are incorporated into the report’s disclosures, ensuring a comprehensive representation of the group’s sustainability performance.
3. **Geographical Scope:**
   While operations are primarily based in Taiwan, the company also acknowledges its activities in Asia and North America, reflecting its broader market presence.

#### **Inclusion of Value Chain Components**
The report extends its scope to include parts of its supply chain and operational processes, such as:
- Green procurement practices, including sustainable sourcing of materials like SSAP soybeans, RSPO-certified palm oil, and FSC-certified cardboard boxes.
- Supplier evaluations, auditing, and management processes to ensure environmental and social standards are upheld throughout the supply chain.

#### **Verification and Assurance**
The organizational data and performance metrics disclosed in the report are verified by **third-party limited assurance** provided by KPMG in accordance with ISAE 3000. Additionally, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions quantification has been certified by an independent third party, adding to the reliability of the report.

#### **Strengths in Scope Definition**
- The inclusion of all significant subsidiaries and the supply chain demonstrates a comprehensive approach.
- Third-party assurance enhances credibility and stakeholder trust.
- Specific references to international standards (e.g., GRI, SASB, TCFD) ensure that the organizational scope aligns with best practices.

#### **Areas for Improvement**
- While the report outlines the inclusion of subsidiaries and supply chain activities, it could benefit from a more detailed breakdown of operational boundaries, particularly specifying which sustainability metrics apply to individual subsidiaries versus the parent company.
- Expanding coverage to explicitly discuss the scope of indirect impacts, such as those related to downstream operations (e.g., product end-use), could provide a more holistic perspective.

The company has strategically centered its operations around food safety, sustainability, and the development of green enterprises, which are integral to its mission of providing safe and healthy food while envisioning a sustainable future. This commitment is reflected in the alignment with eight of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and through a focused 3R strategy: Recycle, Reduce, and Remodel.

Moreover, the company drives its sustainable development through three main pillars—Smart Factory initiatives, Business Model Transformation, and Green Enterprise practices—each supported by quantifiable key performance indicators (KPIs). This structured approach allows for annual reviews of progress, ensuring that the ESG initiatives are not only conceptual but also practical and measurable.

The report articulates this connection by detailing how the Sustainability Committee, comprising representatives from various departments, guides ESG efforts and integrates them into the company's broader operational strategies. For example, the committee actively manages risks associated with climate change and operational challenges, which highlights the actionable nature of the strategies. Additionally, the committee’s regular meetings and the training of its members in sustainability practices reinforce the commitment to embedding ESG principles into the corporate governance framework.

Furthermore, the report outlines specific sustainable action plans and the establishment of short, medium, and long-term goals, indicating that these initiatives are not just theoretical but are designed to have tangible impacts on the business. This includes expanding the scope of greenhouse gas emissions quantification and implementing measures for energy conservation and waste management, all of which are crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and fulfilling stakeholder expectations.

In summary, the connections between the company's ESG initiatives and its business strategy are clearly articulated and actionable, demonstrating a robust framework for integrating sustainability into its core operations and long-term objectives. This approach not only promotes positive impacts for the company and society but also aligns with global sustainability trends and stakeholder interests.","### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. demonstrates a strong connection between the company’s ESG initiatives and its overarching business strategy. These connections are articulated through strategic goals, operational practices, and measurable outcomes, emphasizing sustainability as a core aspect of the company’s vision and mission.

---

#### **Integration with Business Strategy**

1. **Vision and Mission Alignment:**
   - The company’s mission to provide ""safe and healthy food for all"" and its vision of becoming an eco-friendly corporation underline the centrality of sustainability to its business strategy. These aspirations are directly tied to its ESG initiatives, such as circular economy practices, sustainable farming, and energy-efficient operations.

2. **Strategic Framework:**
   - Fwusow aligns its ESG initiatives with three key pillars:
     - **Smart Factory:** Leveraging technology and AI for operational efficiency and waste reduction.
     - **Business Model Transformation:** Integrating circular economy principles and sustainable procurement practices.
     - **Green Enterprise:** Reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy efficiency.

3. **Sustainability Goals:**
   - The company has established quantifiable short-, medium-, and long-term goals. For example, by 2025, it aims to achieve specific reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity and increases in renewable energy usage (e.g., solar power generation). These objectives are critical to ensuring alignment between ESG actions and business performance.

---

#### **Key ESG Initiatives Supporting Business Strategy**

1. **Climate Change and Energy Efficiency:**
   - Fwusow adopts the **ISO 50001 Energy Management System**, demonstrating its commitment to efficient energy use. The integration of solar panel installations and the replacement of energy-intensive equipment directly supports both environmental sustainability and cost efficiency, aligning with the company’s operational goals.

2. **Sustainable Supply Chain Management:**
   - The procurement of SSAP-certified soybeans, RSPO-certified palm oil, and FSC-certified cardboard reflects the company’s dedication to sustainable sourcing. This reduces environmental impact while bolstering supply chain resilience—a critical aspect of its business operations.

3. **Circular Economy Practices:**
   - Initiatives such as agricultural waste recycling and water reclamation contribute to both resource optimization and environmental stewardship. These efforts are explicitly tied to business objectives, including cost savings and meeting consumer expectations for sustainable products.

4. **Innovation and Product Development:**
   - The development of carbon-labeled products and low-environmental-impact goods aligns with market trends and consumer demand for eco-friendly offerings, further integrating ESG principles into the company’s growth strategy.

---

#### **Clarity and Actionability**

1. **Clear Articulation:**
   - The report provides a clear narrative connecting ESG initiatives to the company’s strategy. For instance, its focus on reducing GHG emissions is tied to operational improvements and regulatory compliance, ensuring actionable outcomes.

2. **Use of Metrics and KPIs:**
   - The establishment of measurable targets (e.g., increasing solar energy capacity, reducing waste, and enhancing product sustainability certifications) ensures that ESG initiatives are not only aspirational but also trackable and actionable.

3. **Governance Structure:**
   - The role of the Sustainability Committee in overseeing ESG initiatives ensures accountability and strategic alignment. Regular reporting to the board of directors further integrates ESG considerations into business decision-making.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Clear linkage between ESG goals and business objectives.
   - Use of quantifiable targets and internationally recognized frameworks (e.g., GRI, SASB, TCFD).
   - Strategic focus areas, such as Smart Factory and Green Enterprise, that directly enhance operational efficiency and sustainability.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - While the report outlines the connection between ESG initiatives and business strategy, further detailing the financial impact of these initiatives could enhance transparency.
   - Expanding on how consumer and stakeholder feedback directly informs ESG priorities could provide deeper insights into strategic alignment.

While the report highlights specific sustainability goals, action plans, and performance indicators, it does not provide detailed historical data or direct comparisons with previous years' performance. Instead, it mentions that the sustainability committee monitors progress and assesses achievements annually, which suggests a commitment to evaluating trends over time. However, without specific historical data presented in the report, it is difficult to ascertain the meaningfulness and transparency of such comparisons.

The report adheres to international standards like GRI and includes third-party assurance, which enhances its credibility. Nonetheless, stakeholders seeking a clear view of progress or trends in ESG performance over time may find the lack of historical data comparisons a limitation. Therefore, while the report provides a solid framework for sustainability, it would benefit from incorporating historical performance data to give a fuller picture of progress.","### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. provides meaningful comparisons of its ESG performance data with historical data, demonstrating trends and progress across key sustainability indicators.

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Carbon Footprint:**
   - The report presents a year-on-year analysis of GHG emission intensity. For example, GHG emission intensity decreased from **2.36 kgCO₂/thousand $ in 2019** to **1.61 kgCO₂/thousand $ in 2023**, with intermediate targets set for 2025 and 2030. These comparisons highlight ongoing efforts to reduce emissions and align operations with climate action goals.

2. **Renewable Energy Adoption:**
   - Solar panel energy generation increased significantly, rising from **1,626 kW in 2019** to **4,181 kW in 2023**. This trend reflects the company’s investment in renewable energy as part of its Green Enterprise initiative.

3. **Sustainable Procurement:**
   - The report tracks the procurement of sustainably sourced materials, such as SSAP soybeans. For example, the use of SSAP soybeans decreased from **73,452 tons in 2019** to **61,931 tons in 2023**, with plans to increase usage to **95,488 tons by 2030**. This fluctuation is accompanied by commitments to enhance sustainable supply chain practices.

4. **Water Resource Management:**
   - The volume of water reclaimed and reused increased significantly, from **10,696 tons in 2019** to **21,162 tons in 2023**, showing notable progress in water conservation efforts.

5. **Product Innovation and Certifications:**
   - The number of products certified with carbon footprint labels remained consistent at **22 in 2023**, with goals to expand to **26 by 2025 and 2030**. This consistency underscores the company’s emphasis on maintaining high standards for environmentally friendly products.

---

#### **Transparency and Meaningfulness of Comparisons**

1. **Clarity of Data:**
   - The report provides clear, year-by-year metrics across key environmental and operational areas, making trends easy to follow. Each data point is accompanied by context, explaining progress or shortfalls, which adds to the transparency of the disclosures.

2. **Quantifiable Targets:**
   - Intermediate and long-term targets (e.g., for 2025 and 2030) are included for several indicators. This provides stakeholders with a roadmap to evaluate whether the company is on track to meet its sustainability goals.

3. **Alignment with Sustainability Goals:**
   - Historical data comparisons are directly tied to the company’s 3R strategy (Recycle, Reduce, Remodel) and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring that progress aligns with broader sustainability frameworks.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Broader Historical Context:**
   - While the report effectively compares recent years, extending comparisons further back (e.g., to 2015 or earlier) for critical areas such as GHG emissions or waste management could provide a more comprehensive view of long-term progress.

2. **Social Performance Metrics:**
   - Although the report includes data on employee benefits, occupational safety, and community engagement, these comparisons lack the same level of historical detail as environmental metrics. Incorporating multi-year trends in social performance would enhance the overall analysis.

3. **Visual Representation:**
   - The inclusion of additional charts or graphs comparing performance over time would make trends more visually accessible to readers and stakeholders.

The company utilizes a mix of water sources, including tap water, recycled water, and groundwater, and has contingency plans to purchase water if restrictions arise. Furthermore, wastewater is treated to meet discharge standards before being recycled for further use, which enhances the overall efficiency of water resource utilization. 

In terms of specific data, the report notes that in 2023, the Charming Food facility used a total of 294,682 tons of municipal water and recycled 32,447 tons of wastewater, resulting in a recycling rate of 11.01%. This represents a slight decrease from 2022, where the recycling rate stood at 12.66%, attributed primarily to reduced production levels leading to less wastewater generation. Additionally, the Shalu plant recycled significant amounts of steam condensate (16,496 tons) and process cooling water (4,666 tons), the latter showing a remarkable increase of 142.52% from the previous year. 

The report also emphasizes proactive measures taken in response to water scarcity, such as the establishment of a crisis management team to adjust production schedules during droughts. This shows a commitment not only to maintaining operational efficiency but also to environmental sustainability. In summary, FWUSOW Industry's report illustrates a comprehensive strategy for managing water resources, integrating data on usage, recycling rates, and initiatives aimed at reducing consumption and enhancing water sustainability.","### **Water Resource Management**

"How does the company assess and disclose the financial and operational risks posed by climate change, such as extreme weather events or regulatory changes?","[""page|source|page_content\n76|./esg_report/FWUSOW_INDUSTRY.pdf|To  comprehensively  assess  the  physical  and  transition  risks  of  climate  change \n\non the company's operations, we employed scenario analysis. Climate Change Risk and Opportunity Matrix\n\nPhysical Risk\n\nWe  refer  to  the  latest  assessment  reports  from  the  Intergovernmental  Panel \non  Climate  Change  (IPCC),  which  include  projections  under  Representative \nConcentration  Pathways  (RCP)  2.6  and  RCP  8.5,  as  well  as  scenario  simulations \nfrom  Taiwan  Climate  Change  Projection  and  Adaptation  Knowledge  Platform \n(TCCiP).

Through  detailed  scenario  analysis, \nwe  proactively  anticipate  potential  risks,  plan  and  execute  necessary  adaptation \nmeasures promptly, mitigate impacts, and ensure operational resilience. Transition Risk\n\nWe  closely  monitor  global  regulations  addressing  climate  change,  specifically \ncarbon  reduction  policies,  regulations,  and  energy  transformation  measures,  as \nthese  can  significantly  impact  our  company's  financial  performance. We  place \nparticular emphasis on Taiwan's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) \ntargets  and  the  direction  of  energy  system  transformation  planning.

Through this process, we have identified a \ntotal of 10 categories of climate transition risks, 10 categories of physical risks, and 2 categories of climate opportunities, totaling 34 climate-related \nissues. Step2 \nRisk and Impact \nanalysis on Operation\n\nWe conduct risk assessments and operational impact analyses for the identified climate issues based on their likelihood, scope of impact, time \nscales (differentiating short-term within 5 years, medium-term 5-15 years, and long-term over 15 years), and their financial implications. We refer \nto Taiwan's Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) targets and various Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios to simulate \npotential impacts of each risk. Throughout this process, we convene cross-departmental meetings to integrate perspectives from various units, \ncomprehensively analyze potential risks, and assess the severity of threats. Step3 \nSignificant Risks/ \nOpportunities \nAssessment\n\nBased on the aforementioned analysis, we have identified significant climate risks  and opportunities  that  will impact  our  company in the  short-\nterm, medium-term, and long-term. A climate risk or opportunity is categorized as significant if its potential financial impact exceeds a materiality \nthreshold of NT$16 million. These significant issues are addressed by a TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) Committee, \nwhich develops response strategies including management objectives and indicators. After approval by the general manager, these strategies are \npresented to the board of directors for review, and the working group is responsible for ongoing monitoring and management. At this stage, we \nhave identified 3 significant transition risks in the short-term and 1 derivative climate opportunity.

This process is guided by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework, which provides a comprehensive structure for identifying and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.

To begin with, the company continuously monitors various sources of information, including international climate risk reports, regulatory updates, and significant events related to climate issues. This ongoing tracking enables the identification of a broad range of climate-related risks and opportunities, which have been categorized into 10 transition risks, 10 physical risks, and 2 climate opportunities. A total of 34 climate-related issues have been identified, each assessed based on their likelihood, scope of impact, time scale (short-term, medium-term, and long-term), and potential financial implications.

The assessment process is structured into several steps. Initially, significant risks and opportunities are evaluated, with a focus on those that exceed a materiality threshold of NT$16 million. The TCFD Committee, comprising senior executives, oversees this evaluation and formulates response strategies to mitigate identified risks. These strategies are then approved by the general manager and presented to the board of directors for further review. The company is committed to transparency, publishing an annual ""Climate-Related Financial Disclosure Report"" that details the financial impacts of climate change, including specific actions taken in response to identified risks.

Furthermore, the company conducts detailed scenario analyses that consider potential changes in climate conditions, such as temperature increases and extreme weather events. These analyses inform the development of action plans aimed at enhancing operational resilience and minimizing adverse impacts on business operations. The company also actively engages in cross-departmental discussions to ensure a comprehensive understanding of risks across different business units, which supports the establishment of effective risk management practices.

In summary, the company’s approach to assessing and disclosing climate-related financial and operational risks is thorough and multifaceted, involving continuous monitoring, scenario analysis, stakeholder engagement, and transparent reporting to ensure that it can effectively manage the challenges posed by climate change.","### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks**

To achieve \nthis  goal,  we  have  implemented  the  ISO  45001  &  TOSHMS  Occupational  Safety \nManagement System and undergo regular external verification by SGS to ensure the \nsystem's effectiveness and continuous improvement. We have an 'Occupational Safety and Health Committee' that meets quarterly to \npropose and coordinate occupational safety and health policies, and review relevant \nmatters  to  ensure  workplace  safety. When  managing  construction  contractors,  we \ninform  them  in  advance  of  potential  hazards. We  conduct  pre-construction  training, \nhold  coordination  meetings,  and  verify  occupational  safety  certifications  and  the \ncorrect use of safety gear. These efforts actively strengthen employees' awareness of \noccupational safety, collectively aiming to prevent accidents. To  assist  employees  in  identifying  workplace  hazards,  we  regularly  conduct \n'Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Control' workshops. Through systematic \nintroductions  and  practical  discussions,  employees  learn  to  master  the  three \nstages  of  hazard  identification,  assessment,  and  effective  control  methods,  thereby \ndeepening their awareness of safety. In the 2023 environmental monitoring report, noise was identified as a significant \noccupational  hazard. In  response,  we  conducted  'Hearing  Protection'  training  for \nemployees  in  affected  work  areas  to  emphasize  the  importance  of  understanding \nnoise  classification  and  wearing  protective  gear. We  have  also  been  progressively \npurchasing improved ear protection to prevent occupational diseases. Another significant issue is falls, which have a high occurrence rate and severity \nin  occupational  accidents. We  continue  to  conduct  'Fall  Prevention  Education  and \nTraining'  along  with  practical  drills. These  sessions  include  videos  and  hands-on \nexperience with safety harnesses to deepen employees' understanding of preventing \nfall  hazards  and  using  protective  equipment  correctly. Given  the  frequent  use  of \nchemicals  in  the  laboratory,  the  proper  use  of  respiratory  protective  equipment  is \ncrucial. We  regularly  conduct  wearability  tests  for  respiratory  protective  equipment \nand  offer  related  training  courses  to  ensure  employees  understand  when  to  use \nvarious  protective  gear,  learn  proper  wearing  methods,  implement  respiratory \nprotection management, and improve their self-testing capabilities. 104\n\nTo  strengthen  our  emergency  response  capabilities,  we  invited  experts  from \nthe  Taichung  City  Fire  Department  to  conduct  fire  prevention  training  at  our  facility. The  training  included  both  theory  and  practical  exercises,  covering  topics  such  as \nfire types, evacuation procedures, fire extinguisher use, and crisis management.

Specifically, the company has adopted the ISO 45001 and TOSHMS Occupational Safety Management Systems, which are regularly verified by external parties to ensure their effectiveness. An Occupational Safety and Health Committee convenes quarterly to discuss and coordinate safety policies, ensuring that all potential hazards are addressed and that employees are well-informed about safety practices.

To promote a culture of safety, the company conducts training workshops focused on hazard identification, risk assessment, and control. In 2023, it identified noise as a significant occupational hazard, leading to ""Hearing Protection"" training for employees in affected areas. Additionally, the report highlights that fall incidents, which have historically been a concern, are addressed through education and practical drills. The company also places a strong emphasis on chemical safety, regularly testing the wearability of respiratory protective equipment and providing thorough training on its use.

In terms of metrics, the report provides specific data regarding occupational accidents. In 2023, the company recorded three occupational accidents, which included two incidents involving hazardous substances and one fall incident. These accidents resulted in a total loss of 53 workdays due to temporary total disability. Additionally, the report notes that no accidents occurred among independent contractors working for the company during the same period.

One of the core initiatives is the establishment of a dedicated human rights policy, which includes guidelines for handling employee complaints and measures to prevent and address sexual harassment. The company has actively implemented these policies through various labor-management meetings and communication channels involving employee representatives. In 2023, the report notes that there was one reported case of sexual harassment, which was effectively investigated and resolved to the satisfaction of the complainant, illustrating the company's commitment to addressing such issues.

In terms of recruitment and hiring practices, the company emphasizes a non-discriminatory approach, where candidates are assessed solely based on their job capabilities, past performance, and relevant experience. This commitment extends to ensuring equal employment opportunities regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, age, or other personal attributes. Furthermore, the company mandates cooperation from partner factories to uphold these human rights policies, reinforcing a culture of fairness and equality in labor practices.

To ensure compliance with fair labor practices across its supply chain, the company conducts supplier evaluations which include the signing of an 'Integrity Transaction Agreement' by suppliers. This agreement prohibits unethical practices such as bribery and requires suppliers to adhere to a 'Supplier Social Responsibility Code of Conduct.' This code encompasses standards related to human rights, labor conditions, occupational health and safety, and anti-corruption practices. Suppliers who fail to meet quality and delivery performance standards are suspended until improvements are made, indicating a rigorous approach to maintaining ethical practices.

Additionally, the report mentions regular audits and assessments of suppliers to ensure they meet the company's standards regarding quality and social responsibility. These evaluations are part of the company's broader commitment to uphold integrity and fair labor practices throughout its operations and supply chain. By integrating these measures, the company aims to foster a positive work environment and mitigate risks associated with human rights violations.","### **Measures to Safeguard Human Rights Across Operations and Supply Chain**
