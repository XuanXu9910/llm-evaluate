The ESG report adheres to several internationally recognized frameworks that guide sustainability reporting and assessment. Notably, it follows the **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)** standards, which provide a comprehensive framework for organizations to report on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. The GRI standards are widely acknowledged for promoting transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting, making them a cornerstone for many organizations, including Asia Polymer Corporation (APC) [Data: Entities (194, 34, 28); Relationships (198, 337, 148)].

In addition to GRI, the ESG report also aligns with the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** framework. TCFD is designed to help organizations disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities, which is increasingly important in today's business environment. APC utilizes TCFD to assess climate risks and opportunities effectively, ensuring that these considerations are integrated into their sustainability practices [Data: Entities (280); Relationships (631, 212, 2115)].

Furthermore, the report is guided by **International Sustainability Regulations and Standards**, which encompass various guidelines, including GRI Universal Standards, SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This alignment with multiple frameworks enhances the credibility and comprehensiveness of the ESG report [Data: Entities (415); Relationships (292, 240)].

## Alignment with Frameworks

The alignment of the ESG report with these frameworks is robust. By following GRI standards, APC effectively communicates its sustainability performance, addressing material topics relevant to its operations, such as supply chain management and environmental assessments. This adherence not only reinforces APC's commitment to sustainability but also ensures that stakeholders receive clear and relevant information regarding the company's ESG practices [Data: Relationships (198, 862, 151)].

Moreover, the integration of TCFD guidelines allows APC to provide insights into climate-related risks, which are critical for informed decision-making among investors and stakeholders. The report's alignment with these frameworks indicates a strong commitment to best practices in sustainability reporting, enhancing the organization's reputation and accountability in the eyes of socially conscious investors [Data: Relationships (631, 240)].

In summary, the ESG report follows internationally recognized frameworks such as GRI and TCFD, ensuring a high level of alignment with global sustainability standards. This commitment to transparency and accountability is essential for fostering trust among stakeholders and promoting responsible corporate governance.","#### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The organizational scope and time frame of the sustainability report are indeed defined, although the specific details regarding the parts of the company included in the report are somewhat limited. The report outlines the entities involved in the sustainability reporting process, which encompasses various aspects of the organization’s operations. However, it does not provide an exhaustive list of subsidiaries or specific supply chain components included in the report [Data: Entities (2226)].

### Reporting Period

The reporting period is mentioned, indicating the timeframe for which the sustainability report is applicable. This is crucial for stakeholders to understand the context of the data presented and the relevance of the findings [Data: Entities (2227)].

### Inclusion of Subsidiaries and Supply Chains

While the report references the parent company and its subsidiaries in relation to consolidated financial statements, it does not explicitly detail which subsidiaries or supply chain elements are included in the sustainability reporting. The focus appears to be more on overarching sustainability practices rather than a granular breakdown of specific entities or supply chain components [Data: Relationships (1198); Entities (1366)].

In summary, while the report establishes a clear organizational scope and reporting period, it lacks detailed specifications regarding the inclusion of specific subsidiaries and supply chain elements. This could be an area for improvement to enhance transparency and comprehensiveness in future reports.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The ESG report of Asia Polymer Corporation (APC) clearly defines its organizational scope and time frame, providing stakeholders with transparency regarding the boundaries and applicability of the report.

1. **Time Frame:**  
   - The report covers the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. APC publishes its sustainability report annually, with the current issue released in August 2024. This ensures a consistent reporting cycle, facilitating year-on-year performance comparisons.

2. **Organizational Scope:**  
   - The report encompasses APC’s operational entities, specifically:
     - **Taipei Headquarters (HQ):** Responsible for sales operations.
     - **Kaohsiung Linyuan Plant:** Focuses on research and development, manufacturing, and shipment.
     - **USI Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.:** Included in the consolidated financial statements.
     - **USI Education Foundation:** Contributions and initiatives related to social engagement are also highlighted.

3. **Supply Chain Inclusion:**  
   - While the report details supply chain management practices, including supplier evaluations and environmental/social impact assessments, the direct scope of the report does not explicitly extend to all supply chain operations. However, supplier compliance with ESG criteria is emphasized, ensuring alignment with APC’s sustainability goals.

4. **Third-Party Assurance:**  
   - The report undergoes a limited assurance process conducted by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, in compliance with Standard on Assurance Engagement 3000. This ensures the credibility of disclosed information.

---

#### **Clarity and Completeness of Scope**

The scope is clearly delineated, ensuring stakeholders can identify which entities and activities are included. For instance:
- APC explicitly states that all financial information aligns with the consolidated financial statements certified by accountants.
- The report aligns with GRI Standards 2021, ensuring a structured approach to defining reporting boundaries.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Comprehensive disclosure of the operational scope and organizational entities covered.
   - Clear alignment with internationally recognized standards (GRI Standards 2021).
   - Inclusion of third-party assurance, enhancing reliability.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - While the operational entities are well-documented, the report could benefit from more explicit details about the inclusion or exclusion of specific supply chain elements.
   - Greater granularity on the environmental and social impacts of subsidiaries and third-party operations would provide a more holistic view.

---

**Conclusion:**  
Asia Polymer Corporation’s ESG report effectively defines its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring transparency for stakeholders. The inclusion of operational entities and third-party assurance strengthens its credibility, though further detailing of supply chain impacts could enhance its comprehensiveness. This approach aligns with best practices for sustainability reporting and supports informed decision-making by stakeholders.",0.0625,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.57,0.6659055750639747

The 2023 ESG Report published by Asia Polymer Corporation (APC) provides a comprehensive overview of the organization's commitment to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. While the report details various aspects of APC's sustainability practices, it does not explicitly mention the comparison of current ESG performance data with historical data to highlight progress or trends over time. The focus appears to be more on outlining current strategies, action plans, and performance metrics rather than providing a longitudinal analysis of past performance against current data.

### Transparency and Meaningfulness of Comparisons

In terms of transparency, the ESG Report is designed to serve as a key communication tool for stakeholders, detailing APC's management approach and disclosures related to environmental and social issues, including metrics on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate-related targets. The report emphasizes the organization's dedication to sustainable development and corporate responsibility, which suggests a commitment to transparency in its reporting practices. However, without explicit historical comparisons, it is challenging to assess the meaningfulness of the data presented.

The report does include information on various ESG achievements and strategies for the years 2023 to 2028, which may imply a forward-looking approach rather than a retrospective analysis. This could limit the ability of stakeholders to gauge the effectiveness of past initiatives and understand trends over time. 

### Conclusion

In summary, while the 2023 ESG Report provides valuable insights into APC's current sustainability practices and commitments, it lacks explicit comparisons of current performance data with historical data. This absence may affect the ability to highlight progress or trends meaningfully. Transparency is present in the reporting of current practices, but the lack of historical context may limit the depth of understanding regarding the company's ESG journey. 

This analysis is supported by the details provided in the ESG Report and related entities [Data: Entities (47, 31, 49); Relationships (153, 858)].","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The company employs a comprehensive approach to assess and disclose the financial and operational risks associated with climate change, particularly focusing on extreme weather events and regulatory changes. This process is crucial for ensuring that stakeholders are informed about potential impacts on the organization’s operations and financial health.

### Framework Utilization

One of the primary frameworks utilized by the company is the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). This framework assists in identifying and disclosing climate-related risks and opportunities, which is essential for effective climate change risk management [Data: Relationships (2108, 631, 630); Entities (280, 37)]. The TCFD provides guidelines that help the company communicate its climate-related financial risks transparently, thereby enhancing decision-making processes and risk management strategies.

### Risk Identification and Management

The company actively identifies various climate-related risks, including physical risks such as flood inundation and drought, as well as transition risks stemming from regulatory changes and market dynamics [Data: Relationships (890, 891, 1335, 1336, 1232)]. By assessing these risks, the organization can develop strategies to mitigate potential financial losses and operational disruptions caused by extreme weather events. For instance, the company has implemented risk management systems that include contingency plans for extreme weather events, ensuring operational stability [Data: Relationships (2388, 327)].

### Reporting and Stakeholder Engagement

To keep stakeholders informed, the company conducts regular Risk Report and Disclosure processes. These reports detail the identified risks and the management strategies in place, ensuring that all relevant parties are aware of the measures being taken to address climate-related challenges [Data: Relationships (425, 757)]. Additionally, the company engages in materiality analysis to evaluate the significance of climate change impacts on its operational performance, further enhancing the transparency of its disclosures [Data: Relationships (95)].

### Conclusion

In summary, the company’s approach to assessing and disclosing climate change risks involves utilizing established frameworks like the TCFD, identifying various risks, and maintaining transparent communication with stakeholders through regular reporting. This proactive strategy not only helps in managing potential impacts but also aligns with broader sustainability goals, ensuring long-term resilience in the face of climate change challenges.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks**

However, it does highlight the importance of transparency and governance practices within the organization, particularly in the **APC 2023 Annual Report**. This report details the governance practices of the Board of Directors and emphasizes compliance with legal requirements, which may encompass anti-corruption measures indirectly [Data: Entities (563); Relationships (40, 106)].
