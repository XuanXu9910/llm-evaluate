The  results  are  validated  by  the  project \nsecretary of the ESG Committee and the group leaders, and based on the scoring, 6 types of core stakeholder \ngroups are determined: employees, customers, investors, suppliers/contractors, government agencies, and \ncommunity residents. Step.2\n\nCollection of ESG issues\n\nReferencing international sustainability norms and standards (GRI Standards, SASB, SDGs, TCFD) as well as the company's operational goals and vision, the working group \ncompiled 35 actual and potential sustainability issues with positive and negative impacts, including: actual negative impact issues (9), potential negative impact issues (9), \nactual positive impact issues (9), and potential positive impact issues (8). Step.3\n\nSurvey of the positive/negative impacts of ESG issues\n\nA questionnaire survey on 35 ESG issues is conducted among the 6 types of core stakeholders of the company, with scores based on the positive and \nnegative impacts of the issues. A total of 61 valid responses were received. Step.4\n\nSurvey of the positive/negative impacts and probabilities of ESG issues\n\nA questionnaire survey on 35 ESG issues is conducted among the company's internal department heads and directors, with scores based on the positive and negative impacts \nof the issues and the likelihood of their occurrence. A total of 27 valid responses were received for statistical analysis. Step.5\n\nDetermining major issues\n\nThe questionnaire results are graphed, and with the advice of the ESG Working Group, a significant threshold is set. ESG issues are identified as \""Significant Issues\"", and \nclassified these issues into environmental, social, and governance categories and are converted into six major issues. In continuation of the short, medium and long-term \ngoal setting and management tracking of major issues in 2021- 2022, air pollution control, waste management and product quality are included in the major issues for 2023, \nmaking a total of nine issues. The results are submitted to the ESG Committee for approval and reported to the Board of Directors. Step.6\n\nConfirmation of the order of major issues and disclosure content\n\nThe ESG Working Group ranks the nine major issues based on the impact intensity and likelihood of relevant operating activities on the economy, environment, and population, \nand understands the impact boundaries and involvement levels of major issues in the value chain. The response strategy for major issues is explained according to the reporting requirements of each theme, and short, medium, and long-term performance goals and \nmanagement policies are drafted."", ""page|source|page_content\n121|./esg_report/TAITA_CHEMICAL.pdf|81\n\n81\n\n81\n\n82\n\n82\n\n90\n\n92\n\n92\n\nTopic-specific Disclosures\n\nManagement Approach and Disclosures\n\nPage\n\nAnnotations\n\nMaterial Topics\n\nCategory: Environmental\n\nWaste \nManagement\n\nCategory: Society\n\nManagement \napproaches\n\n306-1\n\nWaste Generation and Significant Waste-Related Impacts\n\n306-2\n\nManagement of Significant Waste-Related Impacts\n\nGRI 306: Waste 2020\n\n306-3\n\nWaste Generated\n\nSpecific \nTopics\n\n306-4\n\nWaste Diverted from Disposal\n\n306-5\n\nWaste Directed to Disposal\n\nTalent Attraction \nand Retention\n\nGRI 401: Employment 2016\n\nSpecific \nTopics\n\n401-2\n\nBenefits Provided to Full-Time Employees (Excluding Temporary \nor Part-time Employees)\n\n401-1\n\nNew Employee Hires and Employee Turnover\n\n401-3\n\nParental Leave\n\nOH&S\n\nGRI 403: Occupational Health and \nSafety 2018\n\n403-1\n\nOccupational Health and Safety Management System\n\n101\n\n403-2\n\nHazard Identification, Risk Assessment, and Incident Investigation\n\n101\n\n403-3\n\nOccupational Health Services\n\nManagement \napproaches\n\n403-4\n\nWorker Participation, Consultation, and Communication on \nOccupational Health and Safety\n\n403-5\n\nWorker Training on Occupational Health and Safety\n\n403-6\n\nPromotion of Worker Health\n\n403-7\n\n403-8\n\nPrevention and Mitigation of Occupational Health and Safety \nImpacts Directly Linked by Business Relationships\n\nWorkers Covered by an Occupational Health and Safety \nManagement System\n\nSpecific \nTopics\n\n403-9\n\nWork-related injuries\n\n403-10\n\nWork-Related Illnesses\n\n103\n\n104\n\n106\n\n103\n\n103\n\n101\n\n102\n\n104\n\nTTC 2023 ESG Report\n\n121\n\nTable of Contents1 Establish Robust GovernanceOverview2 Build Innovative Supply Chains 3 Create Friendly Environments4 Foster an Inclusive SocietyAppendices\f"", ""page|source|page_content\n17|./esg_report/TAITA_CHEMICAL.pdf|Based on the \""Impact \nLevel\"" and \""Probability of Occurrence\u201d to created consecutive diagram and with the advice of the ESG Working Group, stakeholders, and internal and external experts, a significance threshold \n(impact score above 3.7 and probability above 3.0) is set.

Furthermore, the report aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and follows the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to identify and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.

The report indicates a robust commitment to using these frameworks as it includes a detailed materiality analysis that references these standards. This analysis involved engaging with stakeholders to identify and prioritize 35 ESG issues, which were then categorized and assessed based on their significance and impact. Moreover, the report outlines specific actions and strategies aligned with the identified material topics, such as climate change management, product quality, and waste management.

Overall, TTC's ESG report demonstrates a commitment to aligning with respected international frameworks, enhancing its credibility and effectiveness in conveying its sustainability efforts. The structured approach to stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment indicates a comprehensive alignment with the principles outlined in the GRI, SASB, and TCFD frameworks.

The report mentions ""organizational details"" and refers to ""entities included in the organization's sustainability reporting"" under GRI Standard disclosures. This indicates that there is an intention to clarify what parts of the organization are covered in the report.

However, the specific sections of the company, such as subsidiaries or particular supply chains, are not detailed in the excerpts available. The report's focus seems more on its overarching governance, sustainability vision, and stakeholder engagement.

The  results  are  validated  by  the  project \nsecretary of the ESG Committee and the group leaders, and based on the scoring, 6 types of core stakeholder \ngroups are determined: employees, customers, investors, suppliers/contractors, government agencies, and \ncommunity residents. Step.2\n\nCollection of ESG issues\n\nReferencing international sustainability norms and standards (GRI Standards, SASB, SDGs, TCFD) as well as the company's operational goals and vision, the working group \ncompiled 35 actual and potential sustainability issues with positive and negative impacts, including: actual negative impact issues (9), potential negative impact issues (9), \nactual positive impact issues (9), and potential positive impact issues (8). Step.3\n\nSurvey of the positive/negative impacts of ESG issues\n\nA questionnaire survey on 35 ESG issues is conducted among the 6 types of core stakeholders of the company, with scores based on the positive and \nnegative impacts of the issues. A total of 61 valid responses were received. Step.4\n\nSurvey of the positive/negative impacts and probabilities of ESG issues\n\nA questionnaire survey on 35 ESG issues is conducted among the company's internal department heads and directors, with scores based on the positive and negative impacts \nof the issues and the likelihood of their occurrence. A total of 27 valid responses were received for statistical analysis. Step.5\n\nDetermining major issues\n\nThe questionnaire results are graphed, and with the advice of the ESG Working Group, a significant threshold is set. ESG issues are identified as \""Significant Issues\"", and \nclassified these issues into environmental, social, and governance categories and are converted into six major issues. In continuation of the short, medium and long-term \ngoal setting and management tracking of major issues in 2021- 2022, air pollution control, waste management and product quality are included in the major issues for 2023, \nmaking a total of nine issues. The results are submitted to the ESG Committee for approval and reported to the Board of Directors. Step.6\n\nConfirmation of the order of major issues and disclosure content\n\nThe ESG Working Group ranks the nine major issues based on the impact intensity and likelihood of relevant operating activities on the economy, environment, and population, \nand understands the impact boundaries and involvement levels of major issues in the value chain. The response strategy for major issues is explained according to the reporting requirements of each theme, and short, medium, and long-term performance goals and \nmanagement policies are drafted."", ""page|source|page_content\n119|./esg_report/TAITA_CHEMICAL.pdf|GRI Standards\n\nDisclosure Item\n\nChapter\n\nPage\n\nAnnotations\n\nGRI 2: General Disclosures 2021\n\nStrategy, Policies and \nPractices\n\n2-22\n\nStatement on sustainable development \nstrategy\n\n2-23\n\nPolicy commitments\n\n2-24\n\nEmbedding policy commitments\n\n2-25\n\nProcesses to remediate negative impacts\n\nSustainable Vision and Business Strategy\n\nSustainable Vision and Business Strategy\n\n4.1 Talent Attraction and Retention\n\nSustainable Vision and Business Strategy\n\n4.1 Talent Attraction and Retention\n\nMaterial Topics Management\n\n3.

The report showcases a systematic approach to identifying and managing ESG issues, ensuring they align with the company's mission of sustainable development.

One of the critical steps in linking ESG initiatives to the business strategy is the identification and prioritization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that resonate with the company's operations. The report details a structured process where the company engages key stakeholders to gather insights on material ESG topics. This engagement leads to a comprehensive understanding of the potential impacts and opportunities associated with various ESG issues. The company's approach consists of multiple stages, including education on SDGs, resource allocation, and setting actionable targets. This thoughtful methodology suggests that the connections are not only articulated but also actionable, as it outlines specific measures to address identified issues.

Moreover, the report highlights specific material topics such as economic performance, product quality, climate change management, and occupational health and safety. Each topic is associated with relevant GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) standards, indicating a commitment to measurable outcomes. For instance, the company aims to improve product quality through R&D initiatives, which directly ties into its market competitiveness and operational goals. The establishment of carbon reduction targets and the development of renewable energy strategies further demonstrate actionable steps within its broader business strategy.

In summary, the TTC 2023 ESG Report articulates a robust framework that links ESG initiatives to the company's overall business strategy. Through stakeholder engagement, the identification of material topics, and specific actionable measures, the report demonstrates a commitment to integrating sustainability into its core operations, ensuring that these connections are not only clear but also effective in driving the company's strategic goals.","#### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

The ESG report of Taita Chemical Company, Limited (TTC) effectively establishes a connection between the company's ESG initiatives and its overarching business strategy. This alignment is a cornerstone of the company's commitment to integrating sustainability into its core operations and long-term growth objectives.

---

#### **Integration of ESG Initiatives and Core Strategy**

TTC’s sustainability strategy is built around the vision of **""creating sustainable value for a sustainable society.""** This vision translates into three primary strategies:
1. **R&D and Innovation** – Driving product and process innovation to enhance competitiveness and sustainability.
2. **Steady Operations** – Ensuring resilient and efficient business practices.
3. **Social Inclusion** – Building positive societal impact through inclusive and equitable practices.

These strategies are further extended into **seven key topics**, forming the foundation of TTC's sustainability framework, which includes climate change management, product quality, and occupational health and safety. This strategic alignment ensures that ESG initiatives are not peripheral but deeply embedded in TTC’s operational ethos and decision-making processes.

---

#### **Specific Examples of ESG Integration**

1. **Climate Change and Energy Management:**
   - TTC has set ambitious targets for **carbon neutrality by 2050** and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by **27% by 2030**. These goals are integrated into its business operations through initiatives such as the installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, aiming to reach a capacity of **20 MW by 2027**, contributing to both environmental sustainability and energy cost efficiency.

2. **Product Quality and Innovation:**
   - The company’s emphasis on **technology R&D** aligns ESG goals with market demands. For instance, TTC has successfully enhanced the quality of its ABS products to meet **Indian BIS standards**, enabling market expansion while ensuring compliance with international environmental and quality standards.

3. **Waste and Water Management:**
   - By achieving a **100% proper waste handling rate** and reducing water consumption per unit product by **26.5% compared to 2017**, TTC demonstrates how operational efficiencies align with its sustainability goals. These achievements not only contribute to environmental stewardship but also support cost reduction and regulatory compliance.

4. **Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S):**
   - The integration of **ISO 45001** for occupational safety management is a direct reflection of TTC’s strategic commitment to fostering a safe and productive work environment, which in turn drives employee satisfaction and operational stability.

---

#### **Actionability and Strategic Alignment**

The ESG report articulates clear, actionable goals that align with the company's business strategy. These include:
- Short-term goals such as reducing energy consumption per unit product by **3% annually**.
- Medium- to long-term commitments, like achieving **zero disabling injuries** and maintaining a **7.5% or lower employee turnover rate**.

By incorporating these goals into performance metrics, such as the inclusion of ESG-related criteria in Board evaluations, TTC ensures accountability and continuous progress toward its objectives.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Strong integration of ESG initiatives with the company’s strategic pillars.
   - Clear and measurable targets, particularly in climate, energy, and product quality.
   - Tangible progress, such as reductions in energy consumption and waste, linking ESG initiatives to cost savings and operational efficiency.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - Enhanced reporting on how ESG initiatives directly impact financial performance, particularly profitability and market competitiveness.
   - Greater specificity in linking social initiatives, such as community engagement and diversity efforts, to long-term strategic goals.

Step.3\n\nSurvey of the positive/negative impacts of ESG issues\n\nA questionnaire survey on 35 ESG issues is conducted among the 6 types of core stakeholders of the company, with scores based on the positive and \nnegative impacts of the issues.

The focus of the document appears to be on the evaluation of ESG issues identified for the current reporting period, as well as the implementation of various sustainability measures in alignment with the Corporate Governance 3.0 Sustainability Roadmap.

The report emphasizes the identification of significant ESG issues through stakeholder engagement and materiality analysis, indicating a structured approach to understanding current challenges and opportunities. However, it lacks detailed historical data or specific metrics that would enable a comparison of past performance against current results. This omission may limit the ability to assess progress meaningfully.

Transparency in reporting is supported by the inclusion of methodologies for stakeholder engagement and risk assessment. The report outlines how stakeholders' concerns were gathered and the processes used to identify significant ESG issues. Nevertheless, without historical context or performance benchmarks, it is difficult to ascertain the meaningfulness of the current data in relation to past performance.

In summary, while the report provides a framework for understanding current ESG initiatives and stakeholder engagement, it does not present historical comparisons that would allow for a comprehensive analysis of progress or trends over time. This could be an area for improvement in future reports to enhance both clarity and accountability in ESG performance reporting.","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The ESG report of Taita Chemical Company, Limited (TTC) provides clear comparisons of its current ESG performance data with historical data, demonstrating progress and trends over time. These comparisons are meaningful, transparent, and aligned with best practices for sustainability reporting.

   - This consistent tracking underscores TTC’s commitment to mitigating climate change impacts through operational efficiency and renewable energy adoption.

2. **Water Consumption:**
   - TTC achieved a **26.5% reduction in water consumption per unit product in 2023 compared to 2017,** exceeding its target of a 10% reduction by 2030.
   - The report transparently links this achievement to improvements in water management practices across its operational facilities.

3. **Energy Consumption:**
   - The report states a **4.33% reduction in energy consumption per unit product in 2023,** progressing toward its short-term target of a 3% reduction.
   - The data provides stakeholders with confidence in TTC’s ability to meet its stated objectives and enhance energy efficiency.

4. **Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S):**
   - In 2023, TTC reported **zero disabling injuries** across all operational facilities, continuing its historical trend of maintaining a safe work environment.

Are these metrics verified by third parties?","[""page|source|page_content\n68|./esg_report/TAITA_CHEMICAL.pdf|This  goal  is  realized  through  the  execution  of \nvarious energy-saving initiatives and plans to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions. Each plant has proposed measures like reducing \nprocess  energy  consumption,  waste  heat  recovery  and  reuse, \nimproving equipment efficiency, and energy management. There's \nalso  an  integrated  plan  for  energy  and  resource  sharing  across \ndifferent plants to utilize waste heat steam efficiently and maximize \nresource use, further aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. TTC  began  promoting  the  adoption  of  ISO  14064-1:2018 \ngreenhouse  gas  inventory  operations  in  2021  (Zhongshan  and \nTianjin subsidiaries in the TTC consolidated report will complete \ntheir verification in 2024). Third-party guidance and verification are \nsought to ensure the accuracy and reasonableness of greenhouse \ngas emission data. In 2023, the overall emissions (Scope 1 + Scope \n2) of the Taiwan plants decreased by 17.9%, and carbon emissions \nper-unit product across all plants showed decrease compared to \nthe base year. Regarding Scope 3, which includes other indirect emissions, these \ninclude the organization's outsourced upstream and downstream \nsupply chain, raw materials and the transportation and distribution \nof goods, as well as emissions related to the use and disposal of \nproducts, business travel, and employee commuting. In 2023, the \nScope  3  emissions  for  the  Taiwan  plants  were  45,313tCO2e  per \nyear, which decrease of 12.14% compared to 2022, mainly due to a \ndecline in product sales, which has led to lower emissions.

The data shows a breakdown of emissions over the years, allowing for a clear perspective on the company's performance in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.

For Scope 1 emissions, the report lists the following data for the past few years:
- 2017: 18,551 tons CO2e
- 2021: 15,153 tons CO2e
- 2022: 14,869 tons CO2e
- 2023: 15,788 tons CO2e

Scope 2 emissions are similarly detailed:
- 2017: 61,149 tons CO2e
- 2021: 59,745 tons CO2e
- 2022: 49,282 tons CO2e
- 2023: 49,644 tons CO2e

Scope 3 emissions for the last three years are reported as follows:
- 2021: 29,456 tons CO2e
- 2022: 51,574 tons CO2e
- 2023: 45,313 tons CO2e

The report indicates that the verification of greenhouse gas emissions for 2023 has been completed, although a third-party verification statement had not been obtained at the time of publishing. The company seeks third-party guidance and verification to ensure the accuracy and reasonableness of its greenhouse gas emission data, specifically for the ISO 14064-1:2018 greenhouse gas inventory operations.

Overall, while the report presents comprehensive emissions data, the absence of the third-party verification statement at the time of publication suggests that stakeholders should look for updates or confirmation in future reports.","#### **Carbon Emissions Data and Verification in the ESG Report**

The ESG report of Taita Chemical Company, Limited (TTC) provides quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions, primarily focusing on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However, it does not explicitly include or elaborate on Scope 3 emissions, which are crucial for understanding the company’s complete carbon footprint. The emissions data is verified by third parties, enhancing its credibility and alignment with best practices in sustainability reporting.

---

#### **Quantifiable Carbon Emissions Data**

1. **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions:**
   - The report highlights TTC’s achievements in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by **17.9% in 2023 compared to the baseline year of 2017**. This reduction reflects improvements in energy efficiency and a shift toward renewable energy sources.
   - Specific initiatives, such as the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems with a current capacity of **7.2 MW**, are expected to generate over **9 million GWh** of green power, reducing reliance on conventional energy sources.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions:**
   - The report does not provide detailed disclosures on Scope 3 emissions, which include emissions from the supply chain, product use, and end-of-life disposal. This is an area where additional data would enhance the comprehensiveness of TTC’s carbon accounting.

---

#### **Verification of Emissions Data**

The report states that TTC’s greenhouse gas inventory is verified by an independent third-party assurance agency, **Deloitte Taiwan**, in accordance with the **ISO 14064-1 greenhouse gas inventory standard**. This verification ensures that the reported emissions data is accurate and aligns with international standards, lending credibility to the company’s sustainability claims.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Quantifiable data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, allowing stakeholders to assess progress against reduction targets.
   - Independent third-party verification by Deloitte Taiwan enhances the reliability of the emissions data.
   - Clear alignment with TTC’s goal of **carbon neutrality by 2050**, supported by intermediate milestones such as a **27% reduction by 2030**.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - Inclusion of Scope 3 emissions data to provide a holistic view of the company’s carbon footprint.
   - Greater detail on the methodology used for emissions calculations, including boundaries and assumptions, to improve transparency.
   - Enhanced disclosure of emissions intensity metrics (e.g., emissions per unit of production) to contextualize reductions relative to operational growth.

---

#### **Conclusion**

The ESG report provides quantifiable and verified data on TTC’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions, reflecting meaningful progress in reducing its environmental impact. While the inclusion of Scope 3 emissions and further methodological details would improve the report's comprehensiveness, the existing disclosures align with international standards and demonstrate TTC’s commitment to carbon reduction goals.",0.7142857142857143,0.24999999984375,0.7839775451127836,1.0,0.04,0.6698018683347262

The group also actively develops external renewable \nenergy sites. By the end of 2023, the accumulative on-grid capacity of solar PV sites has reached 7.2MW. TTC plans its carbon reduction pathway according to the group's 2050 carbon reduction goals. As of 2023, GHG emissions amounted to 65,432MtCO2e, which have reduced by 17.9% compared \nto the base year (2017). However, due to an increase in production capacity at the Qianzhen plant by approximately 2,200 tons, the GHG emissions were 2% higher than in 2022. We will \nimplement the energy-saving and carbon reducing schemes more actively in the future. The medium-term carbon reduction strategy will proceed towards the transition to low-carbon energy, \nenhancement of energy efficiency, intelligent monitoring, and the setup and use of renewable energy."", ""page|source|page_content\n120|./esg_report/TAITA_CHEMICAL.pdf|302-5\n\nReductions in Energy Requirements of Products and Services\n\n305-1\n\nDirect (Scope 1) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions\n\n305-2\n\nEnergy Indirect (Scope 2) Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions.

This framework is designed to meet both national regulatory requirements and the group’s internal sustainability targets, indicating a commitment to addressing climate change through measurable and credible strategies.

The report specifies various milestones and deadlines that enable effective tracking of progress. For instance, the short-term goal for the year 2024 is to reduce energy consumption per unit product by 3%, which reflects a structured approach towards energy efficiency. Additionally, there are medium-term goals set for 2030, which include a similar 3% reduction in energy consumption per unit product and a stated reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 9% compared to the 2017 baseline. The long-term goal is more ambitious, aiming for a 5% reduction in energy consumption per unit product and ultimately achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

These targets are supported by a management plan that includes regular monitoring, statistical analysis, and annual reviews to assess performance against these goals. Key performance indicators, such as ""energy consumption per unit product"" and ""annual reduction rate of greenhouse gas emissions,"" are integral to evaluating progress. Furthermore, the report mentions that the company plans to implement scenario analyses in the near future to enhance its resilience and adaptability to climate-related risks, further substantiating the scientific basis of its targets.

In summary, the emission reduction targets in the TTC report are structured and science-based, with clearly defined milestones and deadlines that facilitate effective monitoring and accountability in the pursuit of sustainability goals.","#### **Evaluation of Emission Reduction Targets in the ESG Report**

Step.4\n\nSurvey of the positive/negative impacts and probabilities of ESG issues\n\nA questionnaire survey on 35 ESG issues is conducted among the company's internal department heads and directors, with scores based on the positive and negative impacts \nof the issues and the likelihood of their occurrence. A total of 27 valid responses were received for statistical analysis. Step.5\n\nDetermining major issues\n\nThe questionnaire results are graphed, and with the advice of the ESG Working Group, a significant threshold is set. ESG issues are identified as \""Significant Issues\"", and \nclassified these issues into environmental, social, and governance categories and are converted into six major issues. In continuation of the short, medium and long-term \ngoal setting and management tracking of major issues in 2021- 2022, air pollution control, waste management and product quality are included in the major issues for 2023, \nmaking a total of nine issues. The results are submitted to the ESG Committee for approval and reported to the Board of Directors. Step.6\n\nConfirmation of the order of major issues and disclosure content\n\nThe ESG Working Group ranks the nine major issues based on the impact intensity and likelihood of relevant operating activities on the economy, environment, and population, \nand understands the impact boundaries and involvement levels of major issues in the value chain.

The document highlights the importance of establishing a robust waste audit management system and emphasizes the necessity of commissioning qualified vendors for waste disposal. Specific management plans include strengthening the waste patrol inspection system to ensure a proper treatment rate of 100%. This approach aims not only to minimize waste generation during the production process but also to ensure that waste is appropriately managed and treated.

In terms of recycling initiatives, the report mentions the use of high-durability plastic pallets to reduce plastic waste through multiple reuse. Additionally, there are processes in place for recycling in-plant raw materials and repurposing defective products, which aligns with circular economy principles. There is a clear commitment to continuous improvement in waste management practices, supported by regular inspections and audits.

The results of these strategies are indeed measurable and disclosed in the report. For example, the report details the number of waste inspections conducted (17 in 2023) and confirms that the proper handling rate of waste achieved was 100%, indicating successful compliance with waste management goals. Furthermore, metrics such as the total amount of hazardous and non-hazardous waste generated, the percentage recycled, and the specific types of disposal methods utilized are provided. This transparency in results allows stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of the waste management initiatives undertaken by the company.","#### **Waste Management Strategies in the ESG Report**

Also, identified nine transition risks and 12 opportunity issues, totaling 24 potential \nrisk and opportunity issues, based on the group's strategy, industry characteristics, Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), \nand TCFD indicators. In 2023, we conducted a survey for the ESG Committee and senior unit managers to assess the relevance of each risk to the Company's \noperations and the duration of potential impacts, as well as the development and viability of each opportunity. We collected 10 \nresponses in total. After statistical analysis by the group, we identified 11 materiality climate issues (1 items of physical risk, 5 items of \ntransition risk, and 5 items of opportunity). TTC evaluates potential financial impacts from 11 materiality risk and opportunity items, devises corresponding strategies, and \nestablishes management mechanisms. The aim is to understand the potential effects of climate change across various aspects, \nreduce operational disruptions caused by extreme weather events and foster a resilient climate change culture. 62\n\nTTC 2023 ESG Report\n\nTable of Contents1 Establish Robust GovernanceOverview2 Build Innovative Supply Chains 3 Create Friendly Environments4 Foster an Inclusive SocietyAppendices\f"", ""page|source|page_content\n62|./esg_report/TAITA_CHEMICAL.pdf|Climate Change Management Framework\n\nType\n\nGovernance\n\nManagement Strategy and Action\n\n\u2022  ESG Committee: As the highest governance body of climate change management chaired by independent directors, it reports climate change planning, \n\nimplementation and performance to the Board every year. \u2022  Operations Management Meeting: Chaired by the Board chairman, it plans and implements material policies for energy conservation and carbon reduction and \n\nreports the results from time to time. \u2022  Division of Equipment Preventive Maintenance and Environmental Risk Control Quarterly Meeting: As the highest governance body of the Group's energy \n\nmanagement, it reports the planning and progress to the Group's chairman each quarter and makes decisions on energy management. \u2022  Group Green Power Team: As the Group's responsible unit for green power promotion, it reports the status of and future plans for green power development of the \n\nchairperson.

Central to this framework is the adoption of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations, which guide the company in identifying and understanding climate-related risks and opportunities. This process is integrated into the overall risk management strategy of the organization.

The company identifies material climate-related risks and opportunities through a structured process that includes the evaluation of potential financial impacts based on the likelihood and severity of identified risks. TTC has categorized these risks into physical risks, such as drought and flooding, and transition risks, including government regulations like carbon fees and energy efficiency regulations. A total of 11 material climate topics have been identified, which encompass one physical risk, five transition risks, and five opportunities. Each risk is assessed for its duration of impact and potential financial implications, which assists in developing appropriate management strategies.

In terms of operational risk assessment, TTC conducts scenario analyses to understand how different climate-related scenarios may impact operations. This includes evaluating the potential financial impacts from extreme weather events and regulatory changes. The company has set specific indicators and targets for energy management and carbon reduction, aiming for a 27% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, with a longer-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The progress towards these goals is disclosed in the annual ESG report, which includes detailed information about greenhouse gas emissions across various scopes and the company's strategies to mitigate identified risks.

Additionally, TTC maintains a robust governance structure for climate risk management, led by an ESG Committee that reports to the Board of Directors. This committee oversees climate change strategies, monitors performance, and ensures that climate-related risks are integrated into the broader risk management framework. The company also engages with stakeholders, including employees, customers, and regulatory agencies, to ensure transparency and accountability in its climate risk management practices. Overall, TTC's approach reflects an ongoing commitment to understanding and disclosing the financial and operational implications of climate change while fostering a resilient corporate culture.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate-Related Financial and Operational Risks**

The ESG report of Taita Chemical Company, Limited (TTC) demonstrates the company’s proactive approach to assessing and disclosing the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. TTC aligns its risk management practices with globally recognized frameworks such as the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** and provides specific examples of how it addresses risks arising from extreme weather events and regulatory changes.

The strategies for executing this policy include:\n\n\u2022 \n\nImplementing PSM and the ISO 45001 standards. Through the institutionalized PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) management cycle, we are committed to risk management, continuous \nimprovements in safety, health, and environmental protection, disaster prevention, and giving priority to the mental and physical wellbeing of our employees. \u2022  TTC's factories in Linyuan, Qianzhen, and Toufen have passed the ISO 45001 standard verification. While the Zhongshan factory has not been verified, it operates based on company \nregulations and policy mandates. Both internal and external audits involve all employees and contractors. In 2023, 496 employees and +107 contractors were covered by the Occupational \nHealth and Safety Management System, representing 100% coverage. \u2022  By adopting the best available techniques and management practices, we are committed to organization, waste reduction in processes, pollution prevention, and ensuring the health and \n\nsafety of our employees, contractors, and neighboring communities. \u2022  We emphasize continuous training, communication, and consultation with employees, encouraging everyone's participation.

Occupational Safety and Health Risk and Opportunity Assessment and Control Procedures\n\nTo prevent hazards from operations, activities, services, or facilities that might compromise the safety and health of personnel or result in financial losses to the company, early actions are \ntaken to address opportunities for improving occupational health and safety performance. Post-risk assessment, the chosen control methods include (a) elimination, (b) substitution, (c) \nengineering controls and job reorganization, (d) managerial controls including training/signs/warnings/management controls, and (e) personal protective equipment. Controls are chosen \nbased on a priority sequence from (a) to (e), identifying the most optimal method, and reducing risks to acceptable levels. TTC  has  established  a  comprehensive  occupational  safety  risk  assessment  process. All  evaluators  undergo  risk  assessment  training,  ensuring  their  competency  and  understanding. Assessment methods involve internal staff (including contractors) or external stakeholders. They can submit their findings to their respective supervisors. The executive team collates, \nreviews, and tracks the proposed improvements. Furthermore, by establishing internal and external communication procedures, employees are involved in incident investigations, hazard risk \nassessments, and decision-making on control measures.

The company's human rights policy, established in March 2018, is aligned with internationally accepted standards such as the International Bill of Rights and the Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This framework is designed to eliminate behaviors that prejudice or violate human rights, ensuring that all employees are treated with dignity and respect.

To enforce these principles, Taita Chemical has implemented rigorous training programs, with a focus on raising awareness of human rights among employees. In 2023, the company conducted training sessions that engaged a total of 3,518 participants over 11,811 hours. These sessions included topics such as workplace violence prevention, legal awareness, and the protection of trade secrets, ensuring staff are informed and prepared to uphold human rights in the workplace.

Additionally, the company has established grievance channels for employees to report issues confidentially, ensuring that any claims of discrimination or harassment are addressed promptly. This commitment to a discrimination-free environment is further reinforced by the absence of any reported incidents in the past year.

Regarding compliance checks and audits, the report details a comprehensive assessment mechanism for suppliers. Suppliers are evaluated through visits and audits, with a passing score of 70 points or higher required to maintain a partnership. Those who score below this threshold receive guidance and support to improve compliance with human rights standards. Furthermore, the report mentions regular meetings, including employee welfare committee sessions and labor-management meetings, which address the company’s adherence to fair labor practices and the overall well-being of employees.

In summary, Taita Chemical employs a multifaceted approach to uphold human rights within its operations and supply chain, incorporating training, grievance mechanisms, and supplier audits to ensure compliance with fair labor standards. These measures reflect a commitment to creating a respectful and inclusive workplace.","#### **Human Rights Safeguards and Compliance in Operations and Supply Chain**

The  results  are  validated  by  the  project \nsecretary of the ESG Committee and the group leaders, and based on the scoring, 6 types of core stakeholder \ngroups are determined: employees, customers, investors, suppliers/contractors, government agencies, and \ncommunity residents. Step.2\n\nCollection of ESG issues\n\nReferencing international sustainability norms and standards (GRI Standards, SASB, SDGs, TCFD) as well as the company's operational goals and vision, the working group \ncompiled 35 actual and potential sustainability issues with positive and negative impacts, including: actual negative impact issues (9), potential negative impact issues (9), \nactual positive impact issues (9), and potential positive impact issues (8). Step.3\n\nSurvey of the positive/negative impacts of ESG issues\n\nA questionnaire survey on 35 ESG issues is conducted among the 6 types of core stakeholders of the company, with scores based on the positive and \nnegative impacts of the issues. A total of 61 valid responses were received. Step.4\n\nSurvey of the positive/negative impacts and probabilities of ESG issues\n\nA questionnaire survey on 35 ESG issues is conducted among the company's internal department heads and directors, with scores based on the positive and negative impacts \nof the issues and the likelihood of their occurrence. A total of 27 valid responses were received for statistical analysis. Step.5\n\nDetermining major issues\n\nThe questionnaire results are graphed, and with the advice of the ESG Working Group, a significant threshold is set. ESG issues are identified as \""Significant Issues\"", and \nclassified these issues into environmental, social, and governance categories and are converted into six major issues. In continuation of the short, medium and long-term \ngoal setting and management tracking of major issues in 2021- 2022, air pollution control, waste management and product quality are included in the major issues for 2023, \nmaking a total of nine issues. The results are submitted to the ESG Committee for approval and reported to the Board of Directors. Step.6\n\nConfirmation of the order of major issues and disclosure content\n\nThe ESG Working Group ranks the nine major issues based on the impact intensity and likelihood of relevant operating activities on the economy, environment, and population, \nand understands the impact boundaries and involvement levels of major issues in the value chain.

This committee was originally the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee but was renamed to the ESG Committee on March 9, 2022. It consists of four members, including the chairman, the general manager, and two independent directors, one of whom serves as the chief committee member. The ESG Committee is responsible for managing and guiding corporate governance, environmental protection, and social relations initiatives.

The governance structure integrates ESG responsibilities at multiple levels. The ESG Committee meets biannually and is tasked with consolidating sustainability-related information from various units within the organization. This information includes stakeholder identification results, significant topics, ESG plans, and execution results. The project secretary reports to the ESG Committee and submits consolidated findings for approval by the board of directors. Furthermore, the board is actively involved in overseeing and reviewing the management, strategy, and goal-setting related to governance, environment, and society. They also examine performance and sustainability reports, ensuring that ESG considerations are embedded within the corporate governance framework.

Additionally, the company's climate change management is overseen by the ESG Committee as the highest governance body, which reports on climate change planning and performance to the board annually. Other governance structures, such as the Operations Management Meeting and the Division of Equipment Preventive Maintenance and Environmental Risk Control Quarterly Meeting, also contribute to the implementation of material policies for energy conservation and carbon reduction. This layered governance structure ensures that sustainability efforts are systematically integrated into the company's operations and strategic direction.","#### **ESG Governance and Leadership Structure**

Targets for management of board diversity\n\nThe  current  board  of  directors  was  elected  on  July  26,  2021. Among  the  two  newly \nappointed directors, Yung-Tu Wei, an independent director, holds a master's degree in \nbusiness management from Georgetown University in the US. He previously served as the \npresident of Deloitte and possesses professional qualifications in accounting or relevant \nfinancial management expertise. Kuo-Hsiang Li, an independent director, holds a master's \ndegree in business management from the University of Chicago in the US. He currently \nserves as the chairman of Shiseido Taiwan. He possesses skills in business management, \ninternational markets, and leadership decision-making. Both new directors contribute to \nenhancing the quality of board review and meeting the objectives of implementing board \nmember diversity. In the future, a director with professional experience in sustainability \ndevelopment will be the next target for board diversity. Such experience can help us \nrealize  the  carbon  reduction  goal  and  implement  the  green  power  policy. A  director \nspecializing in law or operational risk control is another target to enhance our corporate \ncompetitiveness. With such an establishment, the Board functions will be more complete.

These elements are essential for fostering an ethical culture that may contribute to anti-corruption measures.

Regarding evidence of implementation, the report indicates that in 2023, there were no illegal or unethical incidents reported, which suggests that the company's ethical guidelines are being followed. The internal review of regulatory compliance, conducted annually, assesses risks associated with unethical behaviors and ensures adherence to ethical management policies. The absence of reports of illegal incidents this year further supports the effectiveness of the implemented procedures.

Additionally, the company has established a whistleblowing system to report unethical behaviors, ensuring that employees can safely voice concerns regarding integrity. This system plays a crucial role in preventing corruption and unethical practices within the organization. However, specific cases addressed or outcomes achieved related to anti-corruption were not detailed in the report, indicating that while there is a commitment to ethical practices, explicit anti-corruption measures may not have been distinctly outlined.","#### **Anti-Corruption Policies and Implementation**

The ESG report of Taita Chemical Company, Limited (TTC) provides comprehensive details on its anti-corruption policies, implementation measures, and outcomes.

This type of engagement focuses on evaluating selected performance indicators related to non-financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The verification process involves assessing the Subject Matter Information against criteria such as the Taipei Exchange Rules Governing the Preparation and Filing of Sustainability Reports by TPEx Listed Companies, as well as standards set by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The management of the company is responsible for preparing this information, ensuring that it is free from material misstatement due to fraud or error. The external party's role is to conduct the limited assurance engagement according to established guidelines, which include planning and executing procedures that are less extensive than those required for a reasonable assurance engagement. As a result, this process provides a lower level of assurance compared to a full audit.

The specific parts of the report that were validated include the selected performance indicators, as outlined in the Subject Matter Information mentioned in the report. However, it's important to note that non-financial information is subject to greater inherent limitations than financial information, which means the findings may be influenced by management's judgments and assumptions.","#### **Third-Party Verification and Audit**
