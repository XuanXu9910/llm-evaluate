These comparisons are structured across various ESG dimensions, offering stakeholders a transparent view of the company’s sustainability journey. Below is an evaluation of these comparisons and their meaningfulness.

#### **Historical Comparisons**

1. **Environmental Performance:**
   - **Waste Recovery Rate:** The report highlights a waste recovery rate of **95%**, reflecting Taisun’s commitment to minimizing environmental impact. However, specific year-on-year comparisons to prior recovery rates are not detailed, which could limit the ability to assess improvement trends quantitatively.

2. **Carbon Emissions and Energy Management:**
   - Taisun reports plans for installing solar panels and transitioning from oil-fired to natural gas boilers, which are part of its strategy to enhance renewable energy use. While these initiatives indicate forward momentum, the report does not include specific historical carbon emission data for comparison, which limits the transparency of trends.

3. **Financial and Operational Metrics:**
   - **Revenue Trends:** The report provides a detailed year-on-year comparison of revenue, showing an increase of **1.12% in 2023** compared to 2022. Historical data for 2021, 2022, and 2023 is presented in tabular format, offering transparency in financial performance.

5. **Social Performance:**
   - **Employee Satisfaction:** A satisfaction rate of **67.31%** is reported for 2023, but the absence of historical satisfaction rates limits insights into whether this reflects an improvement or a decline.

#### **Meaningfulness and Transparency of Comparisons**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The financial data, such as revenue and net profit trends, is transparently disclosed with clear year-on-year comparisons.
   - The report includes measurable ESG targets, such as waste recovery and water reduction, that provide a basis for future comparisons.

### **Evaluation of Comparisons**

The 2023 report partially succeeds in providing meaningful comparisons, particularly in financial performance.

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** outlines the company’s recognition of climate change as a critical issue, emphasizing the need to address both financial and operational risks associated with this global challenge. However, the report provides limited detail on how specific risks, such as extreme weather events or regulatory changes, are assessed and managed. Below is an evaluation based on the disclosures in the report.

---

#### **Identification and Assessment of Climate Risks**

1. **Operational Risks:**
   - Taisun identifies climate-related risks as a potential impact on operational stability, particularly through disruptions caused by extreme weather events. However, the report lacks specific examples or case studies of how these risks have previously impacted operations or how they might do so in the future.
   - The report discusses general measures such as improving energy efficiency and transitioning to more sustainable practices, which could mitigate operational vulnerabilities but does not explicitly tie these measures to specific climate risk scenarios.

2. **Regulatory Risks:**
   - The report acknowledges the potential impact of evolving regulatory frameworks related to climate change, including stricter emission standards and reporting requirements. However, it does not detail how Taisun evaluates or prepares for compliance with these changes.
   - There is no specific mention of costs associated with meeting regulatory requirements or potential penalties for non-compliance, leaving a gap in the assessment of financial risks posed by regulatory changes.

---

#### **Disclosures on Climate Risk Mitigation**

1. **Proactive Measures:**
   - Taisun is implementing projects such as transitioning from oil-fired boilers to natural gas boilers and evaluating solar panel installations. These initiatives reflect a proactive approach to reducing carbon emissions and minimizing exposure to regulatory risks related to fossil fuel use.
   - The company’s target of reducing carbon intensity by 10% aligns with efforts to mitigate climate risks, though the lack of detailed milestones or progress metrics limits transparency.

2. **Governance and Oversight:**
   - The establishment of an **ESG Sustainability Development Committee** under the Board of Directors suggests that climate risks are being integrated into governance structures. However, specific roles or activities of the committee related to climate risk assessment are not disclosed.

---

#### **Financial Impact and Scenario Analysis**

1. **Financial Risks:**
   - The report does not quantify the financial impacts of climate-related risks, such as costs from operational disruptions caused by extreme weather or investments required to meet regulatory standards. Including such analyses would provide stakeholders with a clearer understanding of the financial implications of climate risks.

2. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - The report does not indicate whether Taisun conducts scenario analysis to assess potential outcomes under different climate-related conditions (e.g., a 1.5°C or 2°C global temperature rise scenario). This omission represents a gap in aligning with frameworks such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which encourages scenario analysis as a best practice.

---

### **Strengths in Climate Risk Disclosure**

1. **Acknowledgment of Climate Risks:**
   - The report identifies climate change as a material topic, signaling its importance to Taisun’s sustainability strategy.

2. **Integration of Climate Initiatives:**

4. **Regulatory Preparedness:**
   - Outline specific measures to prepare for and comply with emerging climate regulations, along with associated costs and potential benefits.

---

### **Recommendations**

2. **Enhance Financial Disclosures:**
   - Quantify the financial implications of climate risks and investments in mitigation strategies.

3. **Improve Transparency:**
   - Disclose detailed assessments of both physical risks (e.g., extreme weather) and transitional risks (e.g., regulatory changes) and their potential operational impacts.

4. **Integrate Scenario Planning:**
   - Use scenario planning to anticipate and prepare for varying climate outcomes, ensuring the company’s long-term resilience.
