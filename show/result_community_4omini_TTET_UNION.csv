For example, the total energy savings in 2023 were reported as approximately 551.69 kWh, resulting in an estimated reduction of 272,535 kg of CO2e emissions. Although the report outlines this achievement, a detailed year-over-year comparison of energy efficiency or emissions reductions would enhance visibility into long-term trends.

2. **Economic Performance:**
   - Financial data, including operating revenue, costs, and pre-tax profits, are compared over three years (2021-2023). For example, the report highlights a decrease in operating revenue from NT$20.217 billion in 2022 to NT$18.488 billion in 2023, attributing the decline to reduced market demand and macroeconomic challenges.

3. **Food Safety and Product Quality:**
   - Certifications such as ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 are linked to product quality metrics. The report mentions that 97.06% of the net sales in 2023 came from products manufactured under certified systems, but historical comparisons for these certifications are not detailed, limiting trend analysis.

#### **Overview of Water Resource Management**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report highlights the company’s commitment to sustainable environmental management, including water resource conservation. However, while the report briefly mentions water-related practices, it lacks comprehensive quantitative data on water usage, recycling rates, and reduction measures.

---

#### **Water Usage**

The report identifies water management as an essential component of the company’s sustainability strategy. However, it does not provide specific data on:
- **Total Water Consumption:** No quantitative figures are disclosed regarding the volume of water used in operations.
- **Sources of Water:** Information on whether water is sourced from municipal supplies, groundwater, or other means is absent.
- **Water Intensity:** Metrics reflecting water usage relative to production output are not provided, limiting the ability to assess efficiency improvements.

---

#### **Recycling Rates**

The report does not explicitly discuss water recycling initiatives or provide data on the percentage of water recycled and reused within operations. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate the company’s efforts to promote circular water usage or reduce its reliance on freshwater resources.

---

#### **Measures to Reduce Water Consumption**

While TTET Union Corporation emphasizes resource conservation, the report does not detail specific initiatives or technologies implemented to reduce water consumption. Best practices such as water-efficient processes, leak detection systems, or employee engagement programs to reduce water waste are not described.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**
