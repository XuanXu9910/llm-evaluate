Notable internationally recognized frameworks include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).

The **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)** is a prominent framework that provides comprehensive guidelines for organizations to report on their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts. GRI emphasizes stakeholder engagement and transparency, encouraging companies to disclose their sustainability efforts in a way that is relevant to their stakeholders. Many organizations adopt GRI standards to ensure their reports are aligned with best practices in sustainability reporting.

**SASB** focuses specifically on the financial materiality of sustainability information, providing industry-specific standards that help organizations disclose relevant ESG factors that may impact financial performance. This framework is particularly useful for investors seeking to understand the sustainability risks and opportunities associated with specific sectors.

**TCFD** emphasizes the importance of climate-related disclosures, guiding organizations on how to report climate-related financial risks and opportunities. It encourages firms to provide transparent information about governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics related to climate change.

The alignment of ESG reports with these frameworks varies based on the organization’s commitment to sustainability and the regulatory requirements they must adhere to. Many companies, such as Tairoun, incorporate GRI standards into their sustainability reports, demonstrating a commitment to international guidelines. This integration not only enhances the credibility of the information disclosed but also ensures that the reports meet the expectations of stakeholders regarding transparency and accountability.

Overall, the effectiveness of an ESG report in adhering to these frameworks is crucial for fostering stakeholder trust and demonstrating a genuine commitment to sustainable practices. Organizations that rigorously follow GRI, SASB, and TCFD guidelines are better positioned to communicate their sustainability efforts and address the growing demand for accountability in corporate practices.","### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The ESG report of Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. adheres to internationally recognized frameworks to ensure the credibility and comprehensiveness of its sustainability disclosures. Specifically, the report follows:

   - The report is drafted in accordance with the GRI Standards issued by the Global Reporting Initiative, as highlighted in the editorial principles section. It adopts a core disclosure approach, focusing on material topics relevant to stakeholders and aligned with global sustainability practices.

2. **Third-Party Assurance**:
   - To enhance reliability, the report undergoes independent limited assurance by BDO Taiwan Union & Co. This assurance aligns with GAAP 3000 (""Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information""), which underscores its compliance with international assurance standards.

3. **ISO Standards**:
   - The company integrates ISO standards into its operations, including ISO 22000 for food safety management and ISO 9001 for quality management. These certifications reflect a commitment to internationally accepted operational and reporting practices.

1. **Robust Data Collection and Disclosure**:
   - Tairoun follows structured data collection and measurement methods aligned with GRI Standards, ensuring compliance with local regulations or, where applicable, international and industry-specific standards.

2. **Third-Party Verification**:
   - The engagement of an independent assurance provider reinforces the credibility of the report. By adhering to GAAP 3000, the company demonstrates its commitment to transparency and accountability.

1. **Materiality Analysis**:
   - The company has adopted a structured process to identify material issues that impact stakeholders and its operations. This analysis encompasses environmental, social, and governance dimensions and informs the strategic alignment of sustainability efforts with long-term goals.

2. **Operational Oversight**:
   - Sustainability initiatives are monitored at the departmental level, ensuring accountability. Departments such as the Management Department play a pivotal role in legal compliance, labor safety, and health initiatives, among other responsibilities.

3. **Ethical Corporate Management**:
   - Tairoun’s governance includes a ""Code of Ethical Conduct"" and ""Ethical Corporate Management Best Practice Principles"" approved by the Board. These policies aim to enhance corporate transparency, promote ethical behavior, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
