"Is the organizational scope and time frame of the report clearly defined? Does it specify the parts of the company (e.g., subsidiaries, supply chains) included in the report?",[],"I don't have access to any specific data sources to evaluate the organizational scope or time frame of the report you are referring to. Therefore, I'm unable to determine whether the report clearly defines these aspects or specifies the parts of the company included, such as subsidiaries or supply chains.

For a comprehensive assessment, you would typically look for sections in the report that outline its scope, methodology, and any limitations. These sections often provide details on what parts of the organization are covered, the time period of the data presented, and any relevant exclusions. If you have specific excerpts or information from the report, I could help you analyze that further.","### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** clearly defines its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring transparency and clarity for stakeholders. These aspects are integral to the report's structure, as outlined below:

#### **Time Frame**
- The report discloses information covering the period from **January 1 to December 31, 2023**. 
- It also incorporates some social content that extends before and after the specified period, with relevant numerical explanations and calculation formulas provided as notes. This approach ensures that the report captures both current and transitional aspects of the company's operations.

#### **Organizational Scope**
- The report’s boundaries include Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd. (referred to as Taisun) and its subsidiaries, focusing on operational activities within Taiwan.
- The report explicitly includes data from:

- For food safety and environmental management, the report covers Taisun’s core facilities:

  - **Taisun Aqua Feed Plant**
  - **Beidou Ranch**
- Food production-related disclosures are limited to **consumer food products bearing the Taisun logo**, excluding OEM and feed products.

#### **Key Notes on Scope**
- The report acknowledges discrepancies between the financial data presented and the financial statements, clarifying that:

  - ESG-related information from subsidiaries is not fully synchronized, emphasizing the focus on Taisun’s standalone performance.

#### **Supply Chain Inclusion**
- The report provides insights into supply chain management, particularly in areas such as supplier evaluations and the signing of the ""Integrity and Sustainable Development Commitment"" by vendors. However, the operational details of suppliers or external stakeholders are referenced only within the context of Taisun's direct influence.

This connection is articulated through various governance structures and strategic frameworks designed to ensure that ESG considerations are not only acknowledged but actively pursued in the company’s operational management.

At the core of Taisun's approach is the ESG Sustainability Development Committee, which oversees the integration of ESG factors into the company's strategies. This committee is responsible for approving climate strategies, setting targets, and monitoring the effectiveness of ESG initiatives. The report indicates that the committee regularly reports to the board of directors, ensuring that ESG performance is aligned with corporate governance and operational goals. This governance structure signifies a clear commitment to making ESG a pivotal aspect of business strategy, rather than a peripheral concern.

Furthermore, the report describes specific actionable measures that the company has implemented to address ESG-related challenges. For instance, Taisun has undertaken a ""TCFD Climate Change-related Financial Disclosure"" survey to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities. This proactive approach enables the company to anticipate and respond to potential impacts on its operations and financial performance. The inclusion of measurable goals, such as setting targets for carbon emission reductions and water management, demonstrates a clear linkage between ESG initiatives and the company's broader strategic objectives.

Additionally, the report highlights the company's focus on stakeholder engagement, which is crucial for identifying material issues that impact both the business and its ESG commitments. By engaging with stakeholders and incorporating their feedback, Taisun can refine its strategies to better align with market expectations and regulatory requirements. This stakeholder-driven approach further solidifies the connection between ESG initiatives and overall business strategy, ensuring that actions taken are relevant and responsive to both internal and external pressures.

In conclusion, the report effectively articulates how Taisun's ESG initiatives are integrated into its business strategy through established governance structures, actionable measures, and stakeholder engagement. The clear connections made between ESG goals and operational practices suggest that the company is not only committed to sustainability but is also taking concrete steps to embed these principles into its core business operations. This alignment facilitates not just compliance and risk management but also enhances the company's long-term value and resilience in a changing marketplace.","### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

However, it does mention that updates to information from previous reports are explained in relevant sections, suggesting some level of continuity and tracking of changes over time. The report outlines various aspects of ESG performance, such as governance structures, risk management strategies, and sustainability initiatives, which can imply a framework for assessing progress.

In terms of transparency, the report emphasizes that it has been reviewed and approved by the ESG Sustainability Development Committee and subsequently submitted for limited assurance procedures by Ernst & Young. This indicates a level of external oversight and validation, which can enhance the credibility of the reported data. Furthermore, the mention of specific goals, actions, and stakeholder engagement processes suggests an intention to provide a clear narrative around Taisun's ESG strategy and its evolution.

While the report highlights various metrics and targets, such as those related to greenhouse gas emissions, water management, and ethical supplier practices, it does not present a comprehensive historical performance analysis that explicitly compares current data to past results. Instead, it focuses on outlining current practices and future goals without detailed historical benchmarks. Thus, while there is some indication of tracking and accountability, the absence of explicit comparative data makes it challenging to assess the meaningfulness of the trends presented. Overall, the report aims for transparency through its governance and engagement processes, yet it could benefit from more robust historical data comparisons to better illustrate progress over time.","### **Comparisons of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** incorporates comparisons of current ESG performance with historical data to illustrate progress and trends. These comparisons are structured across various ESG dimensions, offering stakeholders a transparent view of the company’s sustainability journey. Below is an evaluation of these comparisons and their meaningfulness.

#### **Historical Comparisons**

1. **Environmental Performance:**
   - **Waste Recovery Rate:** The report highlights a waste recovery rate of **95%**, reflecting Taisun’s commitment to minimizing environmental impact. However, specific year-on-year comparisons to prior recovery rates are not detailed, which could limit the ability to assess improvement trends quantitatively.
   - **Water Conservation:** A target to reduce water consumption by **2% over three years** is stated, but the report lacks a direct historical comparison to previous years’ water usage, making it difficult to gauge progress within the reporting period.

2. **Carbon Emissions and Energy Management:**
   - Taisun reports plans for installing solar panels and transitioning from oil-fired to natural gas boilers, which are part of its strategy to enhance renewable energy use. While these initiatives indicate forward momentum, the report does not include specific historical carbon emission data for comparison, which limits the transparency of trends.

3. **Financial and Operational Metrics:**
   - **Revenue Trends:** The report provides a detailed year-on-year comparison of revenue, showing an increase of **1.12% in 2023** compared to 2022. Historical data for 2021, 2022, and 2023 is presented in tabular format, offering transparency in financial performance.
   - **Employee Remuneration:** The total remuneration for employees is provided for 2023, but historical data on remuneration levels or trends is not included.

4. **Corporate Governance Metrics:**
   - The report notes a decline in the corporate governance evaluation ranking in 2023 due to governance issues, compared to stronger performance in earlier years. However, quantitative data to highlight specific changes in evaluation scores over time is not provided.

5. **Social Performance:**
   - **Employee Satisfaction:** A satisfaction rate of **67.31%** is reported for 2023, but the absence of historical satisfaction rates limits insights into whether this reflects an improvement or a decline.
   - **Zero Fee for Migrant Workers Initiative:** Although the initiative is highlighted as a key milestone, there is no comparison to previous years regarding the treatment or satisfaction of migrant workers.

---

#### **Meaningfulness and Transparency of Comparisons**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The financial data, such as revenue and net profit trends, is transparently disclosed with clear year-on-year comparisons.
   - The report includes measurable ESG targets, such as waste recovery and water reduction, that provide a basis for future comparisons.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - While progress on some initiatives is discussed qualitatively, the report would benefit from more quantitative comparisons of environmental and social performance metrics over multiple years.
   - Historical benchmarks for key metrics like carbon emissions, water usage, employee satisfaction, and waste recovery rates would enhance the ability to evaluate trends and progress.

---

### **Evaluation of Comparisons**

The 2023 report partially succeeds in providing meaningful comparisons, particularly in financial performance. However, the lack of consistent historical data for many environmental and social indicators limits the transparency and impact of these comparisons. Incorporating detailed, year-over-year metrics for critical ESG dimensions would strengthen the report’s ability to demonstrate Taisun’s progress and reinforce its accountability to stakeholders.

In conclusion, while the report makes commendable efforts to outline performance in 2023, enhancing historical comparisons across all ESG dimensions would provide a clearer and more actionable view of Taisun Enterprise's sustainability progress over time.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.9523809523809524,0.44,0.8485105591889056

It mentions that the company conducts an annual internal greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventory in accordance with ISO 14064-1:2018, but it has not yet met the timeline required for conducting greenhouse gas inventory and assurance. Therefore, there is currently no available information on assurance scope, assurance body, or assurance opinion for these emissions.

The report also indicates that third-party verification of the GHG emissions inventory is scheduled for 2026. This means that while the company is in the process of tracking its emissions, the data has not yet undergone external validation. Consequently, stakeholders looking for verified emission metrics, particularly for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3, will need to wait until the company completes its planned verification process in the upcoming years.","### **Carbon Emissions Data in the ESG Report**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** includes an overview of the company’s initiatives related to carbon management and emission reductions. However, upon review, the report does not provide detailed, quantifiable data specifically on Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 carbon emissions. Below is an analysis based on the report's contents.

#### **Carbon Management Efforts**

1. **Emission Reduction Initiatives:**
   - Taisun reports on its commitment to energy conservation and carbon reduction by adopting measures such as:
     - The construction of a natural gas high-pressure pipeline to replace oil-fired boilers with natural gas boilers, which is expected to significantly reduce emissions once operational.
     - The evaluation of solar panel installations in the Tianzhong area to increase the use of renewable energy.
   - These initiatives align with the company’s broader goal to reduce its carbon intensity by more than 10% and become a leader in carbon management within its industry.

2. **Targets and Goals:**
   - The report mentions a commitment to reducing carbon emissions intensity but does not provide baseline data or specific metrics for comparison. This limits the ability to track progress quantitatively over time.

---

#### **Quantifiable Carbon Emission Data**

1. **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions:**
   - The report does not explicitly disclose quantified data for Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) or Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy) emissions. While the company outlines measures to address these areas, such as the transition to natural gas boilers, the absence of specific metrics diminishes the transparency of its carbon footprint.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions:**
   - Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect emissions throughout the value chain (e.g., supply chain and product lifecycle), are not mentioned in the report. This omission represents a gap in the company’s reporting framework and could hinder comprehensive sustainability assessments.

---

#### **Third-party Verification**

The report does not state whether Taisun’s carbon emissions data, if collected, is verified by third parties. It does, however, mention that the overall ESG report is reviewed and verified by Ernst & Young for limited assurance under Assurance Standard No. 3000. This general verification adds credibility but does not specifically address carbon emissions metrics.

---

### **Evaluation and Recommendations**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Taisun demonstrates a clear commitment to reducing emissions through specific initiatives like transitioning to natural gas and exploring renewable energy options.
   - The report highlights medium- and long-term goals for carbon intensity reduction, indicating a strategic focus on sustainability.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - The report lacks detailed and quantified disclosures for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. Incorporating this data would significantly enhance transparency and accountability.
   - Third-party verification of emissions data should be explicitly addressed to bolster credibility and stakeholder confidence.
   - Setting baselines and interim targets for carbon reduction efforts would provide a clearer framework for tracking progress.

---

### **Conclusion**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of Taisun Enterprise demonstrates the company’s awareness of the importance of carbon management but falls short in providing detailed and quantifiable emissions data. Including Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions metrics, supported by third-party verification, would enhance the report’s transparency and enable stakeholders to better assess Taisun’s progress toward its carbon reduction goals.",1.0,0.0909090908264462,0.0,0.7692307692307693,0.27,0.7421974171391336

However, while there are timelines for these specific goals, the report lacks detailed milestones or intermediate targets specifically for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. 

To summarize, while Taisun Enterprise has set certain targets and timelines, the absence of explicit mention of science-based targets and detailed milestones for emissions reduction suggests that further clarity and commitment are needed in this area.","### **Emission Reduction Targets: Science-based Analysis**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** outlines the company’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and integrating sustainable practices into its operations. However, based on the information provided in the report, it is unclear whether the emission reduction targets are explicitly **science-based**, as defined by frameworks such as the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Below is an evaluation of the emission reduction targets, their alignment with science-based criteria, and the inclusion of milestones and deadlines.

---

#### **Analysis of Emission Reduction Targets**

1. **Emission Reduction Goals:**
   - Taisun sets a goal to reduce carbon emission intensity by more than **10%** over an unspecified baseline period. The company also aims to become an industry leader in carbon management.
   - Specific initiatives include transitioning from oil-fired boilers to natural gas boilers and evaluating the installation of solar panels to increase renewable energy adoption.

2. **Science-based Criteria:**
   - While the report demonstrates a commitment to carbon reduction, it does not specify whether the targets are aligned with scientific methodologies, such as limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C or 2°C, as advocated by the Paris Agreement.
   - The absence of a clear baseline year or quantitative Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 emissions data further limits the ability to assess whether these targets meet science-based criteria.

3. **Milestones and Deadlines:**
   - The report lacks defined interim milestones or deadlines for achieving the 10% reduction in carbon emission intensity. This makes it challenging to track progress effectively or evaluate the company’s alignment with long-term sustainability goals.
   - There is no explicit mention of how frequently Taisun plans to review or adjust its targets based on evolving climate science or operational performance.

---

#### **Strengths in Emission Reduction Initiatives**

1. **Practical Measures:**
   - The planned replacement of oil-fired boilers with natural gas boilers demonstrates actionable steps toward reducing direct emissions.
   - The exploration of solar energy options reflects an interest in transitioning to renewable energy sources.

2. **Commitment to Continuous Improvement:**
   - Taisun’s broader sustainability goals, such as achieving a 95% waste recovery rate and implementing energy-saving measures in production, complement its carbon reduction initiatives.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Lack of Science-based Validation:**
   - The report does not provide evidence that its emission reduction targets are validated by external standards, such as the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). This could raise questions about the sufficiency of its goals in addressing global climate change.

2. **Absence of Milestones:**
   - The report does not include interim milestones or specific deadlines, which limits the ability of stakeholders to monitor and evaluate progress.

3. **Baseline and Scope Details:**
   - A clearly defined baseline year, along with Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emission data, is essential for meaningful assessment and tracking of progress.

---

### **Recommendations**

To enhance the credibility and effectiveness of its emission reduction strategy, Taisun should consider the following:

1. **Adopt Science-based Targets:**
   - Align targets with SBTi or similar frameworks to ensure they are grounded in climate science and contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

2. **Define Milestones and Deadlines:**
   - Establish clear interim milestones and deadlines to track progress. For instance, set annual or bi-annual review points to evaluate the achievement of the 10% carbon reduction goal.

3. **Disclose Comprehensive Emission Data:**
   - Provide detailed Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emission data, along with a defined baseline year, to enable accurate tracking and comparison over time.

4. **External Verification:**
   - Seek third-party validation for emission reduction targets and progress to enhance stakeholder confidence in the company’s sustainability efforts.

---

### **Conclusion**

While Taisun Enterprise demonstrates a clear commitment to reducing emissions and has implemented practical initiatives to support this goal, the absence of science-based targets, defined milestones, and detailed emissions data diminishes the transparency and robustness of its strategy. Aligning its targets with science-based frameworks and incorporating measurable milestones will significantly strengthen the company’s position as a leader in sustainable carbon management.",0.7777777777777778,0.0526315789196675,0.0,1.0,0.27,0.7669725496257472

In terms of total energy consumption, the report indicates that there were fluctuations in energy usage across different years. For example, the total energy consumption was 14,424.31 GJ in 2021, increased to 14,863.19 GJ in 2022, and then decreased to 14,301.65 GJ in 2023. This indicates a slight overall decline when comparing the latest figures to those from two years prior. The average energy consumption per ton of production also saw changes, with an increase from 0.67 GJ/ton in 2021 to 0.80 GJ/ton in 2023, reflecting a rise in energy intensity despite efforts to improve efficiency.

Regarding renewable energy, the report outlines the percentage of energy derived from renewable sources. In 2023, renewable energy usage was reported at 55.26% of total energy consumption. This figure shows a significant commitment to renewable energy, especially as the percentage of purchased electricity increased slightly from 42.33% in 2021 to 43.58% in 2022, before dropping to 40.28% in 2023. The company has also made plans to invest in transitioning from oil-fired boilers to natural gas boilers in 2024, which is expected to further reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy efficiency.

Overall, the report reflects a proactive approach to managing energy consumption through various measures, including regular monitoring of energy usage, replacing outdated machinery, and implementing process improvements. The company's goal to increase renewable energy usage and reduce reliance on non-renewable sources is evident, as is its commitment to continuous improvement in energy efficiency practices.","### **Energy Usage and Efficiency**

In 2023, Taisun reported a total water intake of 744.76 tons, with total wastewater discharge amounting to 397.88 tons and water consumption at 346.88 tons. Notably, compared to the previous year, there was a decrease in water intake by 17.44 tons and a reduction in wastewater discharge by 72.77 tons, indicating a proactive approach towards minimizing water usage.

In terms of recycling, Taisun has implemented water recycling policies that led to a 2% reduction in water withdrawal in 2023, with a target set for a 5% reduction by 2026. The company has established water recycling and reuse facilities across its production lines, which are expected to significantly improve water conservation efficiency. Additionally, new factory buildings are being equipped with water resource recycling systems aimed at further reducing consumption, with a notable goal of increasing the rate of ranch wastewater irrigation for napier grass to 10% by 2026.

The report emphasizes Taisun's commitment to effective water management, detailing the processes in place for monitoring and maintaining water quality. This includes daily checks of pH and residual chlorine levels, as well as monthly microbiological tests. Furthermore, the company acknowledges the challenges posed by climate change, such as erratic rainfall patterns and water quality issues, and is actively seeking to address these through improved operational practices and infrastructure investments. Overall, Taisun's strategies reflect a strong commitment to sustainable water resource management and continuous improvement in water usage practices.","### **Water Resource Management in the ESG Report**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** highlights the company’s approach to water resource management as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability. The report outlines measures aimed at reducing water consumption and improving water resource efficiency. However, it lacks detailed data on water usage and recycling rates, limiting the ability to assess quantitative progress.

---

#### **Water Usage and Reduction Measures**

1. **Reduction Targets:**
   - Taisun has set a goal to reduce water consumption by **2% over three years**. This target reflects the company’s recognition of water resource management as a critical aspect of its sustainability strategy.

2. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - The report emphasizes efforts to improve operational efficiency to minimize water usage, particularly in manufacturing processes. Specific strategies or technologies employed to achieve this reduction, however, are not detailed.

---

#### **Water Recycling and Reuse**

1. **Recycling Rates:**
   - The report does not include quantifiable data on the percentage of water recycled or reused within the company’s operations. While water conservation is identified as a priority, the lack of specific metrics limits transparency in evaluating Taisun’s recycling efforts.

2. **Wastewater Management:**
   - Taisun mentions the management of wastewater as part of its broader environmental responsibility but does not provide detailed data on wastewater treatment processes, discharge volumes, or compliance with regulatory standards.

---

#### **Progress and Historical Comparisons**

1. **Year-over-Year Comparisons:**
   - The report does not provide historical data on water usage or recycling rates, making it challenging to track progress against the stated reduction target.

2. **Measurement and Monitoring:**
   - Although Taisun identifies water resource management as a material topic, the absence of monitoring frameworks or progress reports diminishes the ability to evaluate performance over time.

---

### **Strengths in Water Resource Management**

1. **Acknowledgment of Materiality:**
   - By including water resource management as part of its environmental goals, Taisun demonstrates awareness of its responsibility to conserve this critical resource.

2. **Commitment to Reduction:**
   - The 2% water reduction target over three years establishes a clear objective for improvement in resource efficiency.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Detailed Metrics:**
   - The report should disclose total water usage, recycling rates, and wastewater discharge volumes to provide a comprehensive understanding of its water resource impact.

2. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Including year-over-year comparisons and progress updates on reduction targets would enhance transparency and accountability.

3. **Recycling Initiatives:**
   - Detailed information on water recycling or reuse initiatives, including specific technologies or systems implemented, would strengthen the company’s water management disclosures.

4. **Compliance Data:**
   - Information on compliance with water quality standards or regulatory requirements would demonstrate the company’s commitment to sustainable water practices.

---

### **Recommendations**

To enhance its reporting on water resource management, Taisun should consider the following:

1. **Quantify Water Usage:**
   - Provide data on total water consumption, broken down by operational activities, to enable stakeholders to assess water efficiency.

2. **Track and Report Recycling:**
   - Disclose the percentage of water recycled or reused, along with initiatives to improve recycling rates.

3. **Establish Monitoring Frameworks:**
   - Implement robust monitoring systems to track water usage, recycling, and discharge, with periodic updates on progress toward reduction targets.

4. **Enhance Transparency:**
   - Include compliance data related to wastewater treatment and discharge standards to validate the company’s adherence to environmental regulations.

---

### **Conclusion**

Taisun Enterprise’s 2023 ESG Sustainability Report highlights a commitment to water resource management through reduction targets and efficiency improvements. However, the lack of detailed metrics and progress tracking diminishes the ability to evaluate its performance comprehensively. Incorporating quantitative data and year-over-year comparisons would significantly enhance transparency and stakeholder confidence in Taisun’s water management efforts.",1.0,0.142857142755102,0.5903373773283148,1.0,0.21,0.7502924641855402

The company has set ambitious goals to minimize waste production while maximizing resource recycling. Specifically, they aim to achieve a waste recovery rate of at least 95%, with a mid to long-term goal of maintaining a reuse and recycling rate over 95%. 

The waste management strategies are multifaceted. They focus on three main objectives: minimizing waste production, maximizing recycling, and optimizing supplier management. Taisun employs various methods to enhance waste management, such as conducting annual audits of contracted vendors to ensure proper waste handling and compliance with regulations. The company's production processes are designed to control and reduce in-plant waste, thereby reducing treatment costs. Furthermore, improvements in waste management processes are continuously researched and implemented.

The results of these waste management strategies are indeed measurable and disclosed in the report. For instance, in 2023, Taisun reported producing a total of 1,442 tons of resource-type waste, achieving a recycling rate of 95.99%. Similarly, their aquatic feed factory achieved a recycling rate of 97.97% for resource-type waste. The company's commitment to transparency is reflected in its detailed reporting of waste generation, recycling rates, and the effectiveness of their initiatives, which are tracked and communicated through their sustainability reporting mechanisms.

Overall, Taisun's approach to waste management, coupled with the measurable outcomes of their strategies, demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability and environmental responsibility.","### **Waste Management Strategies in the ESG Report**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** provides an overview of the company’s waste management strategies, emphasizing its commitment to reducing environmental impact through waste reduction, recycling, and a focus on the circular economy. However, the report does not include comprehensive, measurable results for many of these initiatives, limiting stakeholders' ability to assess their effectiveness fully.

---

#### **Waste Management Strategies**

1. **Reduction Efforts:**
   - Taisun aims to improve operational efficiency and reduce waste generation as part of its broader sustainability goals. Specific examples include operational adjustments to minimize waste throughout its production processes.
   - The company has set a target to achieve a **waste recovery rate of at least 95%**, which aligns with its commitment to sustainable resource use.

2. **Recycling Initiatives:**
   - The report highlights recycling as a key component of its waste management strategy, though details about the exact measures implemented or the materials being recycled are not fully disclosed.
   - The company's exploration of eco-friendly packaging options and initiatives to reduce packaging waste suggest an effort to integrate recycling into its supply chain.

3. **Circular Economy:**
   - The report mentions the promotion of sustainable product design, including eco-friendly and reduced packaging options. However, specific details on how circular economy principles are being operationalized or expanded within the company's business model are limited.

---

#### **Results and Measurability**

1. **Waste Recovery:**
   - The report notes the achievement of a **waste recovery rate of 95%**, which is a significant accomplishment in managing production waste. However, it does not provide details on the types of waste recovered or how this rate was calculated, leaving room for improvement in transparency.
   - Year-over-year comparisons or historical data are absent, making it difficult to evaluate progress or improvement over time.

2. **Quantitative Data:**
   - The report lacks detailed metrics on total waste generated, types of waste (e.g., hazardous vs. non-hazardous), and volumes recycled. Including such data would enhance the ability to measure the impact of the company’s waste management efforts.

3. **Circular Economy Results:**
   - While the report alludes to eco-friendly practices and packaging reduction, measurable results or specific case studies illustrating the success of circular economy initiatives are not provided.

---

#### **Strengths in Waste Management**

1. **Clear Recovery Target:**
   - Setting a waste recovery target of 95% demonstrates Taisun’s commitment to resource efficiency and environmental stewardship.

2. **Integration with ESG Goals:**
   - Waste management is aligned with the company’s broader ESG objectives, reflecting its intention to incorporate sustainability throughout its operations.

3. **Eco-friendly Product Design:**
   - The inclusion of eco-friendly packaging and sustainable product design showcases Taisun’s focus on reducing environmental impact at the product level.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Detailed Metrics:**
   - The report would benefit from disclosing specific data on waste generation, recycling rates, and reduction efforts broken down by material types.

2. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Providing year-over-year comparisons or trend analysis for waste reduction and recycling efforts would enable stakeholders to assess the company’s progress.

3. **Circular Economy Framework:**
   - A more comprehensive outline of circular economy initiatives, including measurable outcomes and examples of implementation, would strengthen the report.

4. **Third-party Verification:**
   - Including third-party verification of waste recovery rates and recycling metrics would enhance the credibility of the reported results.

---

### **Recommendations**

To improve waste management disclosures and demonstrate measurable progress, Taisun should consider:

1. **Expanding Data Transparency:**
   - Include detailed data on total waste generated, broken down by type and category, with metrics for waste reduction and recycling.

2. **Enhancing Circular Economy Initiatives:**
   - Provide examples of circular economy projects, such as closed-loop recycling systems or partnerships for sustainable material sourcing.

3. **Establishing Baselines and Comparisons:**
   - Report historical data and progress toward achieving the waste recovery target to showcase long-term improvements.

4. **Verification and Certification:**
   - Seek third-party assurance for waste management performance metrics to ensure accuracy and enhance stakeholder trust.

---

### **Conclusion**

Taisun Enterprise’s 2023 ESG Sustainability Report outlines a commitment to waste management through recovery and recycling initiatives and eco-friendly product designs. However, the absence of detailed, measurable data and year-over-year comparisons limits the transparency and effectiveness of these strategies. Strengthening the disclosure of quantitative results and expanding the focus on circular economy principles would enhance the report’s comprehensiveness and demonstrate greater accountability in waste management practices.",1.0,0.0,0.5258442294230004,1.0,0.46,0.7854182472713096

This process is primarily guided by the recommendations set forth by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which emphasizes the importance of structured governance, strategy implementation, risk management, and the establishment of metrics and targets.

To begin with, the company has established an ESG Sustainable Development Committee responsible for overseeing climate-related risk management and approving relevant strategies. This committee conducts annual assessments and reports to the board of directors to ensure that climate-related risks and opportunities are integrated into the company's overall operational strategy. They identify transition risks (such as regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market dynamics), physical risks (both immediate and long-term due to climate impacts), and potential opportunities (like resource efficiency and energy diversification).

In terms of risk assessment, the company categorizes risks into short-term (1-3 years), medium-term (3-5 years), and long-term (over 5 years). They prioritize the top ten risks in each time frame, focusing first on short-term risks while evaluating medium and long-term risks based on the company's resource capabilities. This structured approach allows for continuous monitoring and adjustment of strategic actions to effectively manage identified risks.

Additionally, the company discloses the impacts of climate change-related risks and opportunities in its sustainability report, addressing how these factors influence its business operations and financials. They also utilize tools from the Taiwan Climate Change Projection Information and Adaptation Knowledge Platform (TCCIP) to assess physical risk scenarios and have adopted a global warming limitation scenario to evaluate both physical and regulatory transition risks. For example, the anticipated implementation of the “Climate Change Response Act,” which will impose carbon fees on high-emission products starting in 2025, has been acknowledged as a potential increase in operational costs.

Moreover, the company is proactive in addressing operational risks resulting from extreme climate conditions, such as disruptions in raw material procurement and transportation. They take measures like diversifying procurement channels and optimizing transportation routes to mitigate these risks. Through this multifaceted approach, the company aims to ensure resilience against climate-related challenges while remaining transparent about the risks and opportunities that arise from climate change.","### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** outlines the company’s recognition of climate change as a critical issue, emphasizing the need to address both financial and operational risks associated with this global challenge. However, the report provides limited detail on how specific risks, such as extreme weather events or regulatory changes, are assessed and managed. Below is an evaluation based on the disclosures in the report.

---

#### **Identification and Assessment of Climate Risks**

1. **Operational Risks:**
   - Taisun identifies climate-related risks as a potential impact on operational stability, particularly through disruptions caused by extreme weather events. However, the report lacks specific examples or case studies of how these risks have previously impacted operations or how they might do so in the future.
   - The report discusses general measures such as improving energy efficiency and transitioning to more sustainable practices, which could mitigate operational vulnerabilities but does not explicitly tie these measures to specific climate risk scenarios.

2. **Regulatory Risks:**
   - The report acknowledges the potential impact of evolving regulatory frameworks related to climate change, including stricter emission standards and reporting requirements. However, it does not detail how Taisun evaluates or prepares for compliance with these changes.
   - There is no specific mention of costs associated with meeting regulatory requirements or potential penalties for non-compliance, leaving a gap in the assessment of financial risks posed by regulatory changes.

---

#### **Disclosures on Climate Risk Mitigation**

1. **Proactive Measures:**
   - Taisun is implementing projects such as transitioning from oil-fired boilers to natural gas boilers and evaluating solar panel installations. These initiatives reflect a proactive approach to reducing carbon emissions and minimizing exposure to regulatory risks related to fossil fuel use.
   - The company’s target of reducing carbon intensity by 10% aligns with efforts to mitigate climate risks, though the lack of detailed milestones or progress metrics limits transparency.

2. **Governance and Oversight:**
   - The establishment of an **ESG Sustainability Development Committee** under the Board of Directors suggests that climate risks are being integrated into governance structures. However, specific roles or activities of the committee related to climate risk assessment are not disclosed.

---

#### **Financial Impact and Scenario Analysis**

1. **Financial Risks:**
   - The report does not quantify the financial impacts of climate-related risks, such as costs from operational disruptions caused by extreme weather or investments required to meet regulatory standards. Including such analyses would provide stakeholders with a clearer understanding of the financial implications of climate risks.

2. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - The report does not indicate whether Taisun conducts scenario analysis to assess potential outcomes under different climate-related conditions (e.g., a 1.5°C or 2°C global temperature rise scenario). This omission represents a gap in aligning with frameworks such as the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which encourages scenario analysis as a best practice.

---

### **Strengths in Climate Risk Disclosure**

1. **Acknowledgment of Climate Risks:**
   - The report identifies climate change as a material topic, signaling its importance to Taisun’s sustainability strategy.

2. **Integration of Climate Initiatives:**
   - The ongoing shift to renewable energy and efforts to reduce carbon intensity demonstrate a commitment to mitigating climate-related risks.

3. **Governance Mechanisms:**
   - The inclusion of climate considerations within the ESG Sustainability Development Committee reflects an effort to integrate these risks into broader corporate governance.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Quantitative Risk Assessment:**
   - Provide detailed financial and operational risk assessments, including quantified potential impacts of climate-related disruptions and regulatory changes.

2. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - Conduct and disclose scenario analysis to evaluate the company’s resilience under various climate change scenarios, aligning with TCFD recommendations.

3. **Operational Examples:**
   - Include case studies or examples of past disruptions caused by climate events and the lessons learned or strategies adopted in response.

4. **Regulatory Preparedness:**
   - Outline specific measures to prepare for and comply with emerging climate regulations, along with associated costs and potential benefits.

---

### **Recommendations**

To strengthen its disclosure and management of climate-related risks, Taisun should:

1. **Adopt TCFD Guidelines:**
   - Align risk disclosure with TCFD recommendations, including governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics/targets.

2. **Enhance Financial Disclosures:**
   - Quantify the financial implications of climate risks and investments in mitigation strategies.

3. **Improve Transparency:**
   - Disclose detailed assessments of both physical risks (e.g., extreme weather) and transitional risks (e.g., regulatory changes) and their potential operational impacts.

4. **Integrate Scenario Planning:**
   - Use scenario planning to anticipate and prepare for varying climate outcomes, ensuring the company’s long-term resilience.

---

### **Conclusion**

Taisun Enterprise’s 2023 ESG Sustainability Report recognizes the importance of addressing climate-related risks but falls short in providing detailed assessments or quantitative disclosures. By aligning its climate risk management practices with international frameworks such as TCFD and incorporating scenario analysis and financial impact assessments, Taisun can enhance transparency and demonstrate its resilience to climate change.",1.0,0.1111111110493827,0.9254164782310051,1.0,0.23,0.7599386095922254

A key element of their commitment is encapsulated in the ""Taisun Declaration of Human Rights Protection,"" which emphasizes the importance of diverse employee composition and gender equality not only to comply with legal standards but also to foster balanced development and succession planning.

To achieve these DEI goals, Taisun has set both short-term and mid-to-long-term objectives. Short-term goals include ensuring that promotions are not restricted by gender and that there is adequate employment of minority groups and persons with disabilities. In 2023, Taisun employed 7 members from minority groups, such as Taiwan’s indigenous people, and 11 persons with disabilities, reflecting their commitment to providing equal opportunities and reducing barriers for socially disadvantaged groups. Importantly, there were no inequality complaints reported in 2023, suggesting effective implementation of their policies.

The company's data on employee demographics supports their DEI initiatives. For instance, in 2023, promotions were awarded to 70 employees, with approximately 34% being female and 66% male. This indicates a recognition of gender representation in promotion practices, although it also highlights the need for further efforts to improve female representation in leadership roles. Additionally, the workforce is predominantly composed of younger employees, with about 70% under the age of 50, which may influence the dynamics of diversity within the organization.

Taisun’s approach to salary equality also plays a crucial role in promoting equity. The company has a structured salary system that aims to provide equal pay for equal work, with a focus on gender pay equality and local hiring. While there is an acknowledgment that a higher proportion of managerial positions are held by male employees, Taisun is actively working towards increasing compensation for female employees and ensuring that promotions are based on performance rather than gender.

Overall, Taisun Enterprise's policies and initiatives reflect a comprehensive strategy to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace, supported by specific data that outlines their progress and areas for improvement.","### **Employee Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policies and Initiatives**

Supplier Management Strategy\n\nTo avoid risks of cost increases or supply abnormalities, the purchase strategy focuses on diversified \n\nsuppliers. Under reasonable prices, long-term cooperation models are established with suppliers to \n\nmaintain price and quality levels, stabilize sources, and reduce raw material supply management risks. While \n\nmaintaining good mutual trust and cooperation relationships with existing suppliers, Taisun continuously \n\ndevelops new suppliers and cultivates suppliers that meet requirements. For raw material supplier selection, Taisun conducts strict reviews. Cooperating suppliers must operate \n\nlegally, and their products or services must meet production requirements, with reasonable prices and high \n\ncooperation. The entire raw material procurement process must be reviewed and confirmed by relevant \n\ndepartments such as R&D and quality assurance, with priority given to suppliers with food-related \n\ncertifications to enhance quality management standards. Additionally, Taisun actively promotes the signing of the \u201cIntegrity and Sustainable Development \n\nCommitment\u201d by suppliers. The commitment covers integrity management, labor rights, environmental \n\nprotection, consumer protection, and respect for third-party intellectual property rights, advocating for \n\nsuppliers to value corporate social responsibility. In 2023, 14 new raw material suppliers with transaction \n\namounts over 100,000 TWD all signed the integrity management commitment, achieving a 100% signing rate. Taisun conducts annual supplier audits, gathering relevant personnel to fill out the \""Taisun Cooperative \n\nSupplier Management Review Scoring Form.\"" Based on the review scores, a supplier evaluation plan \n\nis drafted, and written or on-site evaluations are conducted according to the plan.

Instead, the focus appears to be on material themes related to ethical management, regulatory compliance, corporate governance, and environmental sustainability. 

While the document mentions community relations as one of the material themes, it does not elaborate on specific initiatives or programs aimed at community development. There is a general commitment to promoting sustainable development and enhancing corporate influence through ethical management principles. However, without explicit details on community initiatives or their measurable impacts, it is difficult to ascertain the company's direct contributions in these areas.

In summary, while the company acknowledges the importance of community relations within its corporate governance framework, there are no detailed disclosures or measurable impacts related to community development initiatives such as education, healthcare, or infrastructure in the provided data. For more comprehensive information, further investigation into additional reports or sections of the ESG report may be necessary.","### **Community Development Contributions**

to the board \n\nfor decision-making reference. Remuneration Determination Process\n\nThe company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation stipulate that if there is a profit in the current year, \n\nmore than 2% should be allocated as employee compensation and less than 5% as director \n\ncompensation. However, if the company still has accumulated losses, it should reserve the amount \n\nRemuneration \n\nCommittee Charter\n\nfor compensation in advance. The recipients of the aforementioned employee compensation in \n\nstocks or cash may include employees of controlling or subordinate companies who meet certain \n\nconditions. Managers\u2019 remuneration includes salary and bonuses. The salary takes into account \n\nindustry standards as well as job title, position, education (experience), professional ability, and \n\nresponsibilities. Bonuses are based on an overall consideration of managers\u2019 participation in \n\ncompany operations and performance evaluations. Evaluation items include financial indicators \n\n(financial and business performance indicators) and non-financial indicators (leadership, moral \n\nconduct, regulatory compliance of supervised departments) and measure other special contributions, \n\nconsidering future company risks, incorporating them into performance evaluation and remuneration \n\ndistribution considerations, reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and submitted to the board \n\nfor resolution.

This procedure aligns with the Assurance Standard No. 3000, which pertains to assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information. The verification process requires an assessment of selected sustainability performance indicators included in Taisun's 2023 Sustainability Report. 

The assurance process involves evaluating the scope of the information presented in the report, which includes a focus on sustainability-related performance metrics. However, it is important to note that while the report has been reviewed, the company has not yet completed its greenhouse gas inventory and assurance timeline. As a result, specific information regarding the assurance scope, body, standards, or opinions related to greenhouse gas emissions is currently unavailable.

The quality assurance team at Taisun is composed of 35 members, with a significant percentage having backgrounds in food science. This team is responsible for the oversight of the quality assurance system, ensuring that all products meet food safety and quality standards. While the report mentions the ongoing efforts to improve professional competencies among QA personnel through external training, the full scope of the assurance engagement is still pending further data on the greenhouse gas inventory.","### **Verification and Audit of the ESG Report**

The 2023 ESG Sustainability Report of **Taisun Enterprise Co., Ltd.** outlines its approach to verification and auditing, primarily focusing on internal controls and processes to ensure compliance with operational and financial standards. However, third-party verification of certain environmental metrics is planned but not yet fully implemented.

---

#### **Internal Verification and Oversight**

1. **Internal Audit Framework:**
   - Taisun has established a robust internal control system and internal audit implementation rules to monitor compliance and operational efficiency. These are conducted in accordance with the ""Regulations Governing Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies"".
   - In 2023, the company implemented five audit plans, covering 32 operational areas. These plans, including statutory audits and risk assessments, were approved by the Board of Directors.

2. **Audit Committee Role:**
   - The Audit Committee, composed entirely of independent directors, supervises the internal control system's effectiveness. The committee held multiple meetings in 2023, ensuring adherence to governance requirements and addressing significant issues.

3. **Self-Evaluation:**
   - An internal control self-assessment was conducted in December 2023, culminating in the issuance of the ""Internal Control System Statement"" after Board approval.

---

#### **Third-Party Verification**

1. **Environmental Metrics:**
   - Taisun conducts an annual internal greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory based on ISO 14064-1:2018 standards. Third-party verification of GHG emissions is planned for 2026, indicating a future commitment to external assurance.

2. **Product Certifications:**
   - Food safety and supplier quality standards are subject to certifications such as HACCP, ISO 22000, and FSSC 22000. These certifications are conducted by third-party organizations, ensuring adherence to international standards.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Comprehensive internal audit system with clear reporting structures and active involvement of the Audit Committee.
   - Planned third-party verification of environmental metrics, reflecting a forward-looking approach to external assurance.
   - Existing product-related certifications verified by third-party organizations.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - The lack of third-party verification for the ESG report's overall content limits the credibility of certain disclosures.
   - A more accelerated timeline for third-party assurance of GHG data could enhance transparency and stakeholder confidence.

---

### **Recommendations**

1. **Accelerate Third-Party Verification:**
   - Consider advancing the timeline for GHG data verification to strengthen trust among stakeholders and demonstrate proactive ESG commitment.

2. **Expand Assurance Scope:**
   - Extend third-party verification to encompass additional ESG dimensions, such as governance and social impact metrics, ensuring comprehensive external validation.

3. **Enhanced Disclosure:**
   - Publish detailed verification processes and outcomes in future reports to provide greater transparency regarding the assurance framework.

---

### **Conclusion**

While Taisun Enterprise has a well-structured internal verification system and demonstrates a commitment to third-party verification in specific areas, broader and more immediate implementation of external assurance practices would significantly enhance the credibility of its ESG disclosures.",0.8181818181818182,0.0869565217013232,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.7076947494371599

Additionally, international research reports and governments worldwide are paying more attention to climate change issues. This has led \n\nto strengthened regulatory measures and legal amendments in various countries to address areas where change is possible, prompting \n\nbusinesses to incorporate climate change issues into their operational management. Taisun, besides learning to identify operational risks \n\nbrought about by climate change, also refers to the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures) recommendations \n\npublished by the Financial Stability Board (FSB).

It details specific, measurable objectives along with the strategies that will be employed to reach these targets.

The company has articulated various short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals across several ESG dimensions. For instance, in terms of **corporate governance**, the aim is to be ranked among the top five publicly listed companies in governance evaluations by peers, while ensuring zero violations in food safety regulations.
