---

#### **Historical Comparisons in Key Performance Areas**

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions and Carbon Footprint:**
   - The report presents a year-on-year analysis of GHG emission intensity. For example, GHG emission intensity decreased from **2.36 kgCO₂/thousand $ in 2019** to **1.61 kgCO₂/thousand $ in 2023**, with intermediate targets set for 2025 and 2030. These comparisons highlight ongoing efforts to reduce emissions and align operations with climate action goals.

2. **Renewable Energy Adoption:**
   - Solar panel energy generation increased significantly, rising from **1,626 kW in 2019** to **4,181 kW in 2023**. This trend reflects the company’s investment in renewable energy as part of its Green Enterprise initiative.

3. **Sustainable Procurement:**
   - The report tracks the procurement of sustainably sourced materials, such as SSAP soybeans. For example, the use of SSAP soybeans decreased from **73,452 tons in 2019** to **61,931 tons in 2023**, with plans to increase usage to **95,488 tons by 2030**. This fluctuation is accompanied by commitments to enhance sustainable supply chain practices.

4. **Water Resource Management:**
   - The volume of water reclaimed and reused increased significantly, from **10,696 tons in 2019** to **21,162 tons in 2023**, showing notable progress in water conservation efforts.

5. **Product Innovation and Certifications:**
   - The number of products certified with carbon footprint labels remained consistent at **22 in 2023**, with goals to expand to **26 by 2025 and 2030**. This consistency underscores the company’s emphasis on maintaining high standards for environmentally friendly products.

---

#### **Transparency and Meaningfulness of Comparisons**

1. **Clarity of Data:**
   - The report provides clear, year-by-year metrics across key environmental and operational areas, making trends easy to follow. Each data point is accompanied by context, explaining progress or shortfalls, which adds to the transparency of the disclosures.

2. **Quantifiable Targets:**
   - Intermediate and long-term targets (e.g., for 2025 and 2030) are included for several indicators. This provides stakeholders with a roadmap to evaluate whether the company is on track to meet its sustainability goals.

3. **Alignment with Sustainability Goals:**
   - Historical data comparisons are directly tied to the company’s 3R strategy (Recycle, Reduce, Remodel) and UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring that progress aligns with broader sustainability frameworks.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Broader Historical Context:**
   - While the report effectively compares recent years, extending comparisons further back (e.g., to 2015 or earlier) for critical areas such as GHG emissions or waste management could provide a more comprehensive view of long-term progress.

2. **Social Performance Metrics:**
   - Although the report includes data on employee benefits, occupational safety, and community engagement, these comparisons lack the same level of historical detail as environmental metrics. Incorporating multi-year trends in social performance would enhance the overall analysis.

3. **Visual Representation:**
   - The inclusion of additional charts or graphs comparing performance over time would make trends more visually accessible to readers and stakeholders.

The report does provide quantifiable data on the company’s carbon emissions, specifically through the GHG emissions inventory. This inventory is a comprehensive assessment that includes both direct and indirect emissions, which are essential for understanding the organization's overall environmental impact. The GHG emissions are reported under the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, which encompass various scopes of emissions, including Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions [Data: Entities (205, 238); Relationships (536, 872)].

## Third-Party Verification

To enhance the credibility and reliability of the reported emissions data, the company employs third-party verification processes. An independent third-party vendor is responsible for verifying the GHG emissions inventory for the main plants, ensuring that the reported figures are accurate and compliant with established standards [Data: Entities (1407, 158); Relationships (1503, 32)]. This verification process is crucial for maintaining transparency and trust with stakeholders, as it confirms the integrity of the sustainability reports disclosed by the company [Data: Entities (160, 1727); Relationships (32)].

In summary, the report includes quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions, verified by independent third parties, which underscores the organization's commitment to sustainability and responsible environmental management.","### **Carbon Emissions Data and Verification**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. provides detailed quantifiable data on its carbon emissions, covering multiple scopes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The report also highlights the third-party verification of these metrics, ensuring transparency and reliability.

---

#### **Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 Emissions**

1. **Scope 1 Emissions:**
   - Scope 1 emissions refer to direct emissions from company-owned or controlled sources. The report quantifies these emissions as part of its broader GHG inventory process. However, specific numerical data for Scope 1 emissions is not distinctly separated in the disclosed information. The focus is primarily on aggregated GHG reductions and improvements.

2. **Scope 2 Emissions:**
   - Scope 2 emissions, which are indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, or steam, are included in the company’s carbon accounting framework. The report mentions efforts to reduce these emissions through energy efficiency measures, including solar panel installations and equipment upgrades under the ISO 50001 Energy Management framework.

3. **Scope 3 Emissions:**
   - Scope 3 emissions, encompassing all other indirect emissions in the value chain, such as supplier and consumer activities, are partially addressed. Initiatives like sustainable procurement of SSAP soybeans and RSPO-certified palm oil, as well as reductions in transportation-related emissions via locally sourced raw materials, suggest attention to Scope 3-related impacts. However, explicit quantification of Scope 3 emissions is not provided.

---

#### **Third-Party Verification**

- The report emphasizes that the company’s GHG emissions inventory is verified and certified by an independent third party. This verification adds credibility and aligns with international reporting standards. Additionally, the company adheres to **GRI 2021 Standards**, which require rigorous reporting of environmental impacts.

- Specific certifications mentioned include:
  - **ISO 50001** for energy management.
  - **Limited Assurance by KPMG** under **ISAE 3000 standards**, covering various sustainability metrics, including GHG emissions.

---

#### **Strengths in Reporting**

1. **Quantifiable Metrics:**
   - While not explicitly segmented, the inclusion of data on GHG emissions intensity (e.g., kgCO₂ per thousand dollars of revenue) demonstrates measurable progress. For example, the report highlights a reduction in GHG emissions intensity from **2.36 kgCO₂/thousand $ in 2019** to **1.61 kgCO₂/thousand $ in 2023**, showcasing significant improvement.

2. **Verification by Third Parties:**
   - Third-party assurance through recognized frameworks strengthens the reliability of the emissions data and demonstrates a commitment to transparency.

3. **Alignment with Energy Efficiency Initiatives:**
   - Actions like solar panel installations and sustainable sourcing contribute directly to reducing Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Detailed Segmentation of Scopes:**
   - The report could benefit from providing specific figures for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions separately. This granularity would offer a clearer picture of the company’s carbon footprint and enable stakeholders to evaluate its reduction strategies more effectively.

2. **Scope 3 Quantification:**
   - Although the report includes initiatives related to Scope 3 emissions, such as sustainable procurement and transportation efficiency, explicit numerical data is absent. Quantifying Scope 3 emissions would demonstrate a more comprehensive approach to value-chain sustainability.

3. **Comparison with Industry Benchmarks:**
   - Incorporating comparisons with industry standards or benchmarks for emissions intensity would add further context to the company’s performance.

The emission reduction targets outlined in the report are indeed structured to be science-based, aligning with established metrics and targets for sustainability. Specifically, the targets are designed to measure progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving sustainability goals, which is a critical aspect of effective environmental management [Data: Entities (1410, 1374); Relationships (865)]. 

### Milestones and Deadlines

The report specifies that the year 2024 is a significant deadline for achieving specific annual reduction targets related to electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This indicates a clear timeline for organizations to meet their goals, which is essential for tracking progress effectively [Data: Entities (1107); Relationships (2169, 2170)]. 

Additionally, the actions taken in 2022 are evaluated against these established metrics and targets, further emphasizing the importance of milestones in the overall strategy [Data: Relationships (2298)]. The structured approach to setting these targets, along with the defined deadlines, supports a robust framework for monitoring and reporting on sustainability efforts.

### Conclusion

In summary, the emission reduction targets are science-based and include specific milestones and deadlines, particularly focusing on the year 2024 for significant achievements. This structured approach is vital for organizations committed to reducing their environmental impact and ensuring accountability in their sustainability initiatives.","### **Emission Reduction Targets: Science-Based Approach and Milestones**

The 2023 Sustainability Report of Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. outlines the company’s emission reduction targets, presenting a structured approach to addressing climate change. While the targets demonstrate a clear commitment to environmental sustainability, they lack explicit confirmation of alignment with science-based criteria, such as those outlined by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The inclusion of milestones and deadlines provides a framework for tracking progress.

---

#### **Emission Reduction Targets**

1. **Quantifiable Goals:**
   - The company aims to reduce its **GHG emission intensity** (measured as kgCO₂ per thousand dollars of revenue) from **2.36 in 2019** to **1.65 by 2030**, with intermediate milestones:
     - **2023:** 1.61 kgCO₂/thousand $
     - **2025:** 1.89 kgCO₂/thousand $

2. **Energy Transition Efforts:**
   - Significant investment in renewable energy is evident, with solar energy capacity increasing from **1,626 kW in 2019** to **4,181 kW in 2023**. Targets for solar power generation include further expansions to **3,735 kW by 2030**, representing milestones for renewable energy adoption.

3. **Circular Economy Contributions:**
   - Targets also address indirect emissions through circular economy initiatives, such as increased recycling of agricultural waste and local procurement strategies to minimize transportation-related emissions.

---

#### **Are the Targets Science-Based?**

The report does not explicitly state that the company’s emission reduction targets are validated by the **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)** or aligned with global frameworks like the **Paris Agreement**. While the targets are ambitious and focus on reducing emission intensity and enhancing energy efficiency, the lack of explicit science-based validation limits the assurance that these targets align with the broader goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C.

---

#### **Milestones and Deadlines**

1. **Defined Milestones:**
   - The report includes clear milestones for progress:
     - Intermediate targets for GHG intensity (2025: 1.89 kgCO₂/thousand $).
     - Solar energy generation milestones for 2025 and 2030.

2. **Tracking Mechanisms:**
   - The company employs ISO 50001-certified energy management systems to monitor energy consumption and GHG reductions, indicating a systematic approach to tracking progress.

3. **Accountability and Verification:**
   - Third-party assurance of GHG inventory data by independent auditors (e.g., KPMG) provides a mechanism for verifying progress against these milestones.

---

#### **Strengths in Target Setting**

1. **Quantifiable Metrics:**
   - The targets for emission intensity and renewable energy adoption are specific, measurable, and time-bound.

2. **Integration with Broader Goals:**
   - The targets align with the company’s strategic pillars, such as Smart Factory and Green Enterprise initiatives, which embed sustainability into operational processes.

3. **Third-Party Verification:**
   - Independent assurance adds credibility to the emission reduction claims and progress tracking.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Science-Based Validation:**
   - Fwusow could enhance its credibility by seeking validation of its targets through SBTi or explicitly aligning them with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C pathway.

2. **Detailed Sector Benchmarks:**
   - Comparing targets with industry-specific benchmarks or peer performance would provide additional context for stakeholders.

3. **Scope 3 Emissions Inclusion:**
   - While Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are addressed through renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives, more explicit targets for Scope 3 emissions (e.g., supply chain and consumer impacts) would demonstrate a holistic approach to carbon reduction.

---

### **Conclusion**

Fwusow Industry Co., Ltd. has set ambitious and quantifiable emission reduction targets with clear milestones and deadlines, supported by third-party verification. However, the absence of explicit science-based validation limits the alignment of these targets with global climate goals. Incorporating science-based methodologies and expanding the scope of reduction efforts, particularly for Scope 3 emissions, would strengthen the company’s commitment to addressing climate change effectively.",0.1764705882352941,0.0,0.7896781922733798,0.2777777777777778,0.29,0.699008198383934
