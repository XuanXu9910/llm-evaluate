   - While the SDG alignment is evident, providing more explicit mapping of individual targets and performance metrics against each SDG could improve transparency.
   - The report could benefit from enhanced integration of **biodiversity-related frameworks** or metrics, given the global emphasis on this emerging area.
   - Expansion of disclosure on the implementation outcomes of TCFD recommendations, particularly on scenario analysis and climate risk impacts.

The report specifies that it does not cover other subsidiaries or joint venture companies, indicating a focused approach on the primary operations of Grand Pacific Petrochemical. This means that stakeholders should be aware that the insights and data presented primarily pertain to the main entity rather than a broader network that includes all affiliated entities.

Regarding the time frame, the report aligns with standard practices in sustainability reporting, as it notes the issuance of the report before August 31st, which suggests a regular annual reporting cycle. The reporting period appears to be consistent with the company's previous disclosures, although specific dates are not mentioned in the excerpts provided.

Furthermore, the report identifies the significant topics for disclosure that stem from an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) questionnaire, which helps to highlight the areas of focus within the defined organizational scope. The inclusion of various themes, particularly from the SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and FSC (Financial Supervisory Commission) indicators, indicates a comprehensive approach to capturing relevant sustainability metrics within the specified organizational boundaries.

In summary, while the report outlines its primary focus on the main operations of Grand Pacific Petrochemical and establishes a clear time frame for reporting, it also acknowledges the exclusion of certain subsidiaries and joint ventures, which may limit the comprehensiveness of the insights for stakeholders interested in the entire corporate ecosystem.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame in the ESG Report**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** provides a clearly defined organizational scope and time frame, ensuring transparency in its coverage and reporting boundaries.

---

### **Organizational Scope**

The report specifies the entities and operations included within its scope:
1. **Primary Focus:**
   - The report focuses on the activities and performance of **Nan Ya Plastics’ Taipei/Taichung offices** and the **Kaohsiung plant**, as these are the primary operational sites contributing to the company’s environmental, social, and governance initiatives.

2. **Exclusions:**
   - Subsidiaries and joint ventures are explicitly excluded unless otherwise noted, thereby limiting the scope to the core operational units of the company. This ensures clarity regarding the entities being assessed in the report.

3. **Customer and Product Coverage:**
   - The main customers are chemical material manufacturers, with sales of **ABS/Nylon products** covering regions including China, Europe, America, and Japan. For **styrene monomer (SM)** products, the focus is predominantly on domestic sales. These disclosures clarify the product and market focus within the scope of the report.

4. **Value Chain:**
   - Although the report does not extend to supply chains in detail, it addresses specific downstream impacts, such as customer health and safety and product labeling. Limited upstream and supply chain impacts are discussed, primarily focusing on **supplier sustainability management** and carbon emissions inventory where applicable.

---

### **Time Frame**

The report clearly defines the time period covered:
1. **Primary Reporting Period:**
   - The ESG data and achievements presented cover the period from **January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023**.

2. **Inclusion of Previous Data:**
   - Certain performance data include comparisons with 2022, providing continuity and context for year-over-year analysis.

3. **Publication Details:**
   - The report was issued in **August 2024**, adhering to its commitment to annual publication. The next report is expected in **June 2025**, ensuring a predictable reporting cycle.

4. **Consistency in Operational Activities:**
   - The report states that no significant changes occurred in the company’s operational activities, products, services, or value chain entities during the reporting period, offering stability in the scope of analysis.

---

### **Strengths in Defining Scope and Time Frame**

1. **Clarity and Transparency:**
   - The report specifies its focus on key operational facilities and excludes subsidiaries and joint ventures unless explicitly noted, ensuring stakeholders understand the boundaries of the data presented.

2. **Annual Reporting Commitment:**
   - By adhering to a regular reporting schedule, the company demonstrates accountability and consistency in ESG disclosures.

3. **Third-party Verification:**
   - The carbon inventory data for the Kaohsiung plant has been independently verified by **SGS**, adding credibility to the reported scope.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Supply Chain Coverage:**
   - While the report mentions **supplier sustainability management**, it lacks detailed disclosure on upstream supply chain impacts, such as emissions or material sourcing. Expanding this section would enhance the completeness of the organizational scope.

2. **Downstream Impact Analysis:**
   - A more detailed evaluation of downstream impacts, such as product end-of-life management or customer use-phase emissions, could strengthen the report’s comprehensiveness.

---

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** effectively defines its organizational scope and time frame, focusing on key facilities and ensuring clear boundaries for analysis. While improvements could be made in supply chain and downstream impact coverage, the report meets essential transparency and disclosure standards for stakeholders.",1.0,0.0,0.5721429060935627,0.8181818181818182,0.44,0.7998723543972868

This integration is grounded in their commitment to ethical corporate management, continuous improvement in environmental protection, and care for vulnerable groups. The report emphasizes that these ESG policies are not merely regulatory compliance measures but are intrinsic to the company's operational framework and future growth strategy.

Key to this integration is the establishment of the ESG Steering Committee, which operates under the Board of Directors and is responsible for making decisions that align ESG performance with the company’s broader strategic goals. The committee conducts regular reviews of ESG initiatives and their effectiveness, demonstrating a commitment to accountability and continuous improvement. This structure ensures that ESG considerations are woven into the fabric of the company's strategic planning and operational processes, thus making them actionable.

Furthermore, the report outlines specific steps taken to link ESG initiatives with business operations. For instance, the company employs a ""Plan-Do-Check-Act"" (PDCA) management model, which facilitates a systematic approach to identifying stakeholder concerns, assessing ESG performance, and reporting on these efforts in a structured manner. This method allows for effective communication of the company's sustainability efforts, thus fostering transparency with stakeholders and aligning these efforts with the company’s overall objectives of sustainable growth and market expansion.

Additionally, the report aligns its ESG initiatives with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), articulating how these goals are prioritized and integrated into their business model. By measuring and evaluating the impact of their ESG activities against these global standards, the company demonstrates a proactive approach to sustainability that resonates with both investors and customers. This approach not only enhances the company's reputation but also creates a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

In summary, Grand Pacific Petrochemical's ESG report effectively links its sustainability initiatives to its business strategy by establishing a robust governance structure, employing actionable management models, and aligning with international sustainability standards. The connections are clearly articulated, making them both practical and relevant to the company's growth and operational success.","#### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** demonstrates a clear integration of ESG initiatives with the company’s overarching business strategy. These connections are articulated in various sections of the report, emphasizing the alignment of sustainability goals with operational and financial objectives. Below is a detailed analysis of how these links are established and their actionable nature.

---

### **Strategic Integration**

1. **Core Business and Sustainability Alignment:**
   - The company emphasizes that **styrene monomer (SM)** production remains its core business niche, with ongoing efforts to optimize ABS quality and expand into advanced materials like **Nylon 66**. This core business strategy is intertwined with the development of **low-carbon products**, **recycled materials**, and **green supply chains**, reflecting an actionable commitment to sustainability while maintaining profitability.

2. **Carbon Reduction Goals:**
   - A pivotal aspect of the company’s strategy is its commitment to **net-zero emissions by 2050**, with an interim target to reduce carbon emissions by **45% by 2030** (using 2015 as the base year). This goal aligns with operational priorities, including **energy transition initiatives** (e.g., renewable energy installations and hydrogen economy development) and **carbon reduction in gas-fired power plants**. These actions demonstrate a dual focus on environmental stewardship and cost optimization.

3. **Innovation and Product Development:**
   - The development of **post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR ABS)** and high-performance materials like **super Nylon 66** highlights the company’s focus on integrating ESG principles into product innovation. These initiatives not only address sustainability challenges (e.g., reducing plastic waste and carbon emissions) but also enhance the company’s competitiveness in niche markets.

---

### **Governance and Organizational Structure**

1. **Dedicated Sustainability Leadership:**
   - The appointment of the **Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)** underscores the integration of ESG within the company’s governance structure. The CSO’s role, supported by the **ESG Steering Committee**, involves strategic oversight of sustainability initiatives and their alignment with broader business objectives.

2. **ESG Office and Implementation Teams:**
   - The **ESG Office**, operating under a **Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)** framework, collaborates with implementation teams across dimensions such as **climate change response**, **employee care**, and **social co-prosperity**. This structured approach ensures that ESG objectives are translated into actionable and measurable business outcomes.

---

### **Actionable Connections**

1. **Operational Enhancements:**
   - Specific measures, such as improving ABS dyeing quality and implementing **ISO 50001 energy management systems**, are directly tied to the company’s operational strategy. These efforts not only reduce environmental impact but also enhance product quality and efficiency, creating tangible business benefits.

2. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - The report emphasizes stakeholder inclusivity through materiality assessments, satisfaction surveys, and direct communications. For example, the company’s focus on **customer health and safety** and **supplier sustainability management** reflects actionable strategies to strengthen its value chain.

3. **Revenue and Market Expansion:**
   - The company is actively pursuing opportunities in **low-carbon industries**, **biomass materials**, and **semiconductor electronic chemicals**, indicating that sustainability is not just a compliance exercise but a growth driver. The **660,000 tons/year propane dehydrogenation project** and the **450,000 tons/year polypropylene project** are examples of this alignment.

---

### **Strengths in Connecting ESG and Business Strategy**

1. **Clear Long-term Goals:**
   - The **net-zero emissions** commitment provides a clear long-term objective, supported by interim targets and actionable initiatives.

2. **Product and Market Innovation:**
   - The integration of sustainability into product development ensures alignment with market trends, regulatory requirements, and customer expectations.

3. **Comprehensive Governance Framework:**
   - The structured roles of the ESG Steering Committee and implementation teams ensure accountability and progress tracking.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Enhanced Performance Metrics:**
   - While the report outlines high-level goals and initiatives, more granular performance metrics linked to business outcomes (e.g., ROI from green product development) could strengthen the actionable connection.

2. **Risk Analysis Integration:**
   - The report could benefit from a more detailed analysis of how climate-related risks (as per **TCFD recommendations**) are factored into business decisions, especially for capital-intensive projects.

However, it indicates a comprehensive approach to reporting that includes the assessment of significant sustainability issues, stakeholder engagement, and alignment with established frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards.

The report emphasizes the importance of transparency and stakeholder feedback in its processes. It highlights that the ESG Steering Committee actively reviews the report and incorporates feedback from stakeholders to ensure that the information presented is meaningful and reflects the company’s performance and sustainability impacts effectively. The inclusion of specific themes and the detailed methodologies used for the selection and assessment of these themes suggest a structured and systematic approach to ESG reporting.

While the document mentions that performance data is presented and refers to previous periods, it does not provide explicit examples or metrics that would allow readers to easily track progress or trends over time. The information focuses more on current practices and the selection of significant issues for disclosure rather than a detailed historical comparison. Thus, while the report aims for transparency, the extent to which it effectively highlights progress or trends over time could be seen as limited based on the provided excerpts. For a more in-depth assessment, one would need to review the complete report to determine if additional historical comparisons are included elsewhere.","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** incorporates some comparisons of ESG performance data with historical data to showcase progress and trends over time. However, the depth and scope of these comparisons vary across different ESG dimensions. Below is an evaluation of how effectively the report presents these comparisons and whether they provide meaningful insights.

---

### **Environmental Data**

1. **Carbon Emissions and Energy Use:**
   - The report highlights significant goals, such as a **45% carbon emissions reduction by 2030** and **net-zero emissions by 2050**, using 2015 as the baseline. However, it does not provide detailed historical data for annual emissions, energy use, or renewable energy deployment, which limits the ability to assess year-over-year progress quantitatively.
   - The carbon inventory data for the **Kaohsiung plant**, verified by **SGS**, is a positive step in ensuring the reliability of reported figures, but trends over multiple years are not extensively detailed.

2. **Resource Management:**
   - Efforts to increase water recycling ratios and reduce waste generation are mentioned, but without specific historical or baseline data, the trends in performance over time are not transparent.

---

### **Social Data**

1. **Employee Welfare and Safety:**
   - The report mentions objectives for enhancing occupational safety and reducing workplace accidents through the **ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System**. However, it does not provide historical metrics such as past accident rates or trends in safety performance.

2. **Talent Development:**
   - There is mention of ongoing training and employee retention strategies, but again, without historical metrics (e.g., training hours or retention rates), it is difficult to evaluate progress in these areas.

---

### **Governance Data**

1. **Anti-Corruption and Ethical Practices:**
   - The report emphasizes its zero-tolerance policy for corruption and provides information on training conducted to strengthen ethical awareness. However, there is no comparison of past incidents, compliance breaches, or training participation rates.

2. **Corporate Governance:**
   - Governance-related improvements, such as the establishment of the **Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)** and the **ESG Steering Committee**, are noted as key milestones. While these indicate progress, historical data comparing past governance structures or achievements in oversight is absent.

---

### **Economic Performance**

1. **Financial Metrics:**
   - The report provides a clear comparison of financial performance for **2022 and 2023**, including operating revenue, gross profit, and net income. For instance, **operating revenue decreased by NT$2.46 billion**, and the company’s consolidated net loss after tax increased significantly to **NT$1.46 billion in 2023** from **NT$454 million in 2022**. These comparisons are transparent and highlight the financial challenges faced by the company over the past year.

---

### **Strengths in Historical Comparisons**

1. **Financial Data Transparency:**
   - The report’s detailed financial data, including year-over-year comparisons, is comprehensive and allows stakeholders to understand the company’s economic performance trends.

2. **Environmental Goals:**
   - Long-term environmental goals tied to a clear baseline (2015) provide a meaningful framework for evaluating future progress, even if detailed interim progress data is limited.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Inclusion of Historical ESG Data:**
   - The report could benefit from more comprehensive historical data on key ESG metrics, such as carbon emissions, water use, waste generation, employee safety, and diversity. This would enable stakeholders to assess trends and track progress more effectively.

2. **Graphical Representation:**
   - Including charts or graphs to visualize performance trends over multiple years would enhance the clarity and accessibility of the comparisons.

3. **Narrative Context:**
   - Providing narrative explanations for performance trends (e.g., reasons for improvements or setbacks) would make comparisons more meaningful and actionable.

---

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** includes some year-over-year financial comparisons and outlines ambitious long-term environmental goals, but it lacks detailed historical ESG data and trend analysis. To enhance transparency and stakeholder engagement, future reports should provide more comprehensive and visualized comparisons across all ESG dimensions.",1.0,0.2105263156786703,0.0,0.72,0.35,0.8111537818372683

To begin with, the report emphasizes that Grand Pacific does not extract water from areas of water stress, sourcing its water exclusively from the underflow of the Gaoping River. This measure aligns with the company's commitment to sustainable water management. The report outlines a structured water resources management plan that includes both short-term and long-term strategies aimed at reducing water consumption and enhancing recycling efforts.

In terms of water usage data, the report indicates that the total water consumption for the year 2023 was approximately 2,004 thousand tons, down from 2,469 thousand tons in 2021. Notably, the company has progressively increased its recycled water volume from 100 tons per day in 2020 to a target of 270 tons per day by 2025. The recycling rate for 2023 was reported at 40.21%, with a total recycled water volume of 1,326,775 tons per year, demonstrating a commitment to improving water recycling practices.

The report also details various measures implemented to reduce water consumption. These include a three-step anaerobic biological wastewater treatment system that enables the reuse of treated water for cleaning processes, effectively decreasing tap water usage. The company aims to achieve a water recycling rate of over 65% by 2025, and it is actively developing reclaimed water technology to support this goal. Additionally, it has adopted a water management approach that integrates both internal and external resources, emphasizing the importance of technology in enhancing water-saving processes.

Overall, the report underscores Grand Pacific's proactive stance on water resource management, showcasing significant progress in reducing consumption and increasing recycling rates through systematic strategies and technological advancements.","#### **Water Resource Management in the ESG Report**

of Materiality Issues\n\nBased on the results of the 2023 substantial issue selection, our company utilizes the following process to as-\n\nsess the degree of stakeholder engagement with the Company based on the AA 1000 principles. We calculate \n\nthe weighted average of the attention scores and engagement levels for each issue to understand the stake-\n\nholders\u2019 concerns. For each issue, after confirmation by our company\u2019s ESG Steering Committee and input \n\nfrom internal and external experts, we incorporate the SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) criteria \n\nfor the Chemicals industry and the FSC (Financial Supervisory Commission) disclosure indicators for the chem-\n\nical industry in Taiwan to supplement our assessment of the Company\u2019s economic, environmental, and social \n\nimpacts in 2023.

Specifically, it describes a structured approach toward minimizing waste generation and enhancing resource recycling through adherence to established environmental management systems, such as ISO 14001. This framework guides the company's efforts in managing waste sustainably, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations, and continuously improving practices related to waste management.

To achieve waste reduction, the report mentions initiatives such as the implementation of a sludge incinerator with an hourly capacity to handle waste efficiently. The company has also set a target to reduce the weight of general trash wastes by 5% annually since 2020. Furthermore, it highlights the utilization of three-step anaerobic biological wastewater treatment systems, which are integral to maximizing water recycling and minimizing waste generation.

The results of these strategies are measurable and disclosed in the report. For instance, the report provides quantitative data on waste generated, including weights of various types of waste produced in recent years, and notes the recycling percentages of hazardous and non-hazardous waste. In 2023, the report specifies that the total weight of general business waste was 2,401.16 tons, with a recycling percentage of hazardous waste reported at 0%. The company also aims for a significant water recycling rate of over 65% by 2025, further showcasing its commitment to sustainable practices.

In summary, Grand Pacific Petrochemical's report includes detailed strategies for waste management, articulating specific targets and measurable outcomes that demonstrate the company's commitment to reduction, recycling, and circular economy principles.","#### **Waste Management Strategies in the ESG Report**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** outlines the company’s commitment to sustainable waste management as part of its broader environmental stewardship. The report emphasizes waste reduction, recycling, and circular economy initiatives. However, while strategies are detailed, measurable results and comprehensive disclosures are limited, hindering a full evaluation of progress.

---

### **Strategies for Waste Management**

1. **Reduction and Recycling:**
   - The company underscores the importance of waste reduction, highlighting initiatives such as:
     - Implementation of **ISO 14001 Environmental Management Systems** to systematically manage waste.
     - Promotion of **waste minimization** and increased recycling rates across operational sites.
     - Commitment to using advanced technologies to improve **waste recycling efficiency**.

2. **Circular Economy Initiatives:**
   - The development of **post-consumer recycled plastic (PCR ABS)** demonstrates a focus on integrating waste materials into new production cycles. This aligns with circular economy principles by reducing reliance on virgin materials and mitigating environmental impacts.
   - The company also mentions its aim to manage resources more sustainably through enhanced product life cycle assessments and recycling.

3. **Alignment with SDGs:**
   - Waste management strategies align with **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.5**, which focuses on substantially reducing waste generation through prevention, reduction, recycling, and reuse by 2030.

---

### **Measurable Results and Disclosures**

1. **Data on Waste Management:**
   - The report mentions the company’s efforts to improve waste recycling but does not provide specific data on:
     - Total waste generated.
     - Recycling rates as a percentage of total waste.
     - Progress toward waste reduction goals over time.

2. **Absence of Historical Comparisons:**
   - There is no historical data or year-over-year comparison of waste metrics to demonstrate trends or improvements in waste management practices.

3. **Circular Economy Metrics:**
   - While the report highlights PCR ABS as a key initiative, it does not provide quantitative metrics on how much waste has been repurposed or how these efforts contribute to overall waste reduction.

---

### **Strengths in Waste Management Strategies**

1. **Commitment to ISO Standards:**
   - The use of **ISO 14001** provides a credible framework for waste management and ensures alignment with international best practices.

2. **Focus on Innovation:**
   - The integration of recycled materials like PCR ABS into product development illustrates the company’s proactive approach to advancing a circular economy.

3. **Alignment with Sustainability Goals:**
   - The explicit linkage to **SDG 12.5** demonstrates the company’s alignment with global sustainability objectives, ensuring waste management remains a priority in its ESG strategy.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Detailed Metrics and Disclosures:**
   - The report would benefit from including quantitative data on waste generation, recycling rates, and progress toward specific reduction goals. This transparency would allow stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of waste management strategies.

2. **Year-over-Year Comparisons:**
   - Historical data on waste management would provide a clearer picture of the company’s progress and help benchmark its performance against peers.

3. **Expanded Circular Economy Reporting:**
   - Metrics detailing the impact of PCR ABS and other circular economy initiatives, such as the volume of recycled materials used or reductions in waste sent to landfills, would enhance the report’s comprehensiveness.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** demonstrates a clear commitment to waste management through initiatives such as recycling, circular economy practices, and adherence to international standards like **ISO 14001**. However, the absence of measurable results, specific data, and historical comparisons limits the ability to fully assess the impact of these strategies.

This process is guided by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and incorporates a structured risk management approach.

The company identifies climate-related risks by evaluating both transition risks—stemming from regulatory changes and shifts in market expectations—and physical risks associated with climate impacts, such as droughts and floods. Grand Pacific categorizes these risks and assesses their duration (short-term, mid-term, or long-term) and priority level. For example, acute physical risks from extreme weather events are classified alongside transition risks related to policy compliance and low-carbon trends. The assessment reveals a range of high-priority climate factors, which are systematically analyzed for their potential impacts on the company's operations and financial performance.

To manage identified risks, Grand Pacific implements various countermeasures. These include adhering to energy-saving regulations that mandate a 1% annual reduction in energy consumption, as well as investing in disaster prevention facilities and strengthening supply chain resilience against extreme weather impacts. The company aims for a 40% reduction in carbon emissions by 2040, linking its Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance to reward mechanisms to incentivize compliance with sustainability goals.

In terms of disclosure, Grand Pacific's ESG Steering Committee oversees the reporting of climate-related risks and opportunities. This committee, which includes members of the Board of Directors, regularly evaluates the company’s climate governance performance and reports the findings to stakeholders. The company conducts an annual review of climate-related targets, such as energy-saving and carbon-reduction efforts, ensuring transparency and accountability in its operations. By aligning its strategies with established frameworks and engaging stakeholders in the disclosure process, Grand Pacific demonstrates its commitment to addressing climate change and mitigating its associated risks effectively.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** outlines the company’s approach to identifying and addressing the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. While it highlights certain climate-related risks and mitigation strategies, the depth of analysis and specific disclosures regarding risk impacts and financial implications are limited. Below is a detailed evaluation of the company’s climate risk assessment and reporting.

---

### **Climate Risk Assessment**

1. **Integration of TCFD Recommendations:**
   - The report indicates that the company aligns its climate-related disclosures with the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** framework. This includes an evaluation of climate risks across governance, strategy, and risk management dimensions, particularly focusing on:
     - **Transition Risks:** Regulatory changes, such as carbon pricing and stricter environmental regulations.
     - **Physical Risks:** Potential impacts of extreme weather events on operational continuity.

2. **Governance Framework:**
   - The **Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)** and the **ESG Steering Committee** play central roles in overseeing climate-related risks. This governance structure ensures that climate risks are integrated into decision-making processes and operational strategies.

3. **Risk Categories:**
   - The company categorizes climate risks into:
     - **Regulatory Risks:** Potential cost increases due to stricter emissions regulations or carbon taxes.
     - **Operational Risks:** Disruptions caused by extreme weather events, such as floods or typhoons, particularly at production sites.
     - **Market Risks:** Shifts in demand for low-carbon products and potential competition from peers advancing in renewable energy transitions.

---

### **Disclosure of Climate Risks**

1. **Operational Risks:**
   - The report mentions that climate change could exacerbate operational vulnerabilities, especially in energy-intensive production processes. However, there is no detailed analysis of specific facilities or regions at risk of extreme weather events.

2. **Financial Implications:**
   - While the company acknowledges potential financial impacts from regulatory changes (e.g., carbon pricing), it does not quantify these risks or provide scenario analysis to evaluate their potential costs under different climate scenarios.

3. **Transition Strategies:**
   - The company emphasizes its commitment to **reducing carbon emissions by 45% by 2030** and achieving **net-zero emissions by 2050** as part of its strategy to mitigate regulatory and market risks. Initiatives include increasing energy efficiency, investing in renewable energy, and exploring hydrogen as a fuel source.

---

### **Strengths in Climate Risk Management**

1. **Alignment with TCFD:**
   - The alignment with the **TCFD framework** reflects a commitment to adopting globally recognized practices for assessing and disclosing climate risks.

2. **Strategic Governance:**
   - The involvement of the CSO and ESG Steering Committee ensures climate risks are incorporated into governance and operational strategies.

3. **Focus on Decarbonization:**
   - The company’s decarbonization targets and initiatives, such as the adoption of low-carbon technologies and renewable energy, demonstrate proactive measures to mitigate regulatory and market risks.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Quantification of Risks:**
   - The report lacks detailed financial assessments of climate risks. For instance, quantifying the potential costs of carbon pricing or the financial impact of operational disruptions due to extreme weather would provide a clearer understanding of the company’s exposure.

2. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - Including scenario analysis for different climate pathways (e.g., 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios) would enhance the company’s risk disclosure, helping stakeholders evaluate the resilience of its operations and financial performance under varying conditions.

3. **Physical Risk Analysis:**
   - While the report acknowledges physical risks, it does not specify which facilities or regions are most vulnerable. A more detailed risk mapping exercise would improve transparency and aid in prioritizing mitigation efforts.

4. **Enhanced Disclosure on Adaptation Measures:**
   - The report could provide more information on specific adaptation measures being implemented to address physical risks, such as infrastructure improvements or contingency planning.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** demonstrates a foundational understanding of the financial and operational risks posed by climate change, with alignment to the TCFD framework and clear governance structures in place. However, the disclosures could be strengthened by including quantifiable financial impacts, detailed scenario analyses, and more granular assessments of physical risks. Enhancing these aspects would provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the company’s resilience to climate-related risks and its readiness to navigate a low-carbon future.",1.0,0.0555555555246913,0.6857227055700602,1.0,0.47,0.8004614545307942

Central to these efforts is the company's commitment to appointing talent based on competence rather than gender, age, race, or nationality. This meritocratic approach is reflected in the company's salary approval processes and annual salary adjustments, which are aligned with individual performance, market levels, and overall company profits. In 2023, for instance, the average salary adjustment was around 3%, demonstrating an intention to maintain competitive salaries across the workforce.

Gender equality is a specific focus area, with data indicating that women hold 40% of executive positions within the company. This statistic underscores the company's commitment to gender equity, as it actively selects talents based on their abilities rather than gender. Moreover, Grand Pacific maintains that the basic salary ratios for male and female employees are determined by individual capabilities and job requirements, further emphasizing their policy of equal pay for equal work.

In addition to gender considerations, the company adheres to international human rights conventions and enforces labor equality policies that prohibit forced labor and promote continuous improvement. The company has established communication mechanisms for employees to express grievances, thereby fostering an environment of inclusivity and responsiveness. The Employee Welfare Committee also plays a role in this regard by managing employee welfare funds, which support various initiatives such as holiday bonuses and educational subsidies, contributing to a supportive workplace culture.

Overall, Grand Pacific Petrochemical's focus on DEI is evident through their policies, practices, and the active representation of women in leadership roles, showcasing a commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment.","#### **Policies and Initiatives for Promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**

Firstly, the company is committed to adhering to international human rights standards, particularly those set forth by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” This commitment includes policies aimed at prohibiting forced labor, ensuring sound salary and benefits, and promoting gender equality within the workplace. The company emphasizes the creation of a safe and healthy work environment, free from violence, harassment, and discrimination, and has established a grievance mechanism to address employee concerns regarding labor practices.

In addition to internal measures, the company requires its suppliers to comply with specific human rights standards. This includes the prohibition of child labor, ensuring reasonable working hours and wages, and maintaining environmental safety and health standards. Grand Pacific Petrochemical has integrated sustainability indicators such as RoHS, ISO14001, and ISO45001 into its supplier evaluation process, indicating a commitment to not just compliance with laws but also proactive engagement in ethical labor practices.

To ensure fair labor practices, the report mentions the establishment of a compliance management code and measures for whistleblowing on illegal and immoral behavior. These procedures include mechanisms for reporting grievances, which are applicable to employees, communities, suppliers, and investors. Furthermore, suppliers are subject to audits to verify compliance with the company’s standards, particularly regarding labor rights, occupational health and safety, and environmental protection. The company has also implemented a “New Supplier Evaluation Form” to assess new suppliers against these criteria, and it aims to increase the proportion of suppliers meeting corporate social responsibility (CSR) requirements in subsequent evaluations. 

Overall, these measures, combined with regular audits and a strong commitment to ethical practices, reflect Grand Pacific Petrochemical's dedication to safeguarding human rights throughout its operations and supply chain.","#### **Measures to Safeguard Human Rights Across Operations and Supply Chain**

While the specific report does not provide an exhaustive list of all community development initiatives, it highlights the company's general engagement with local communities, particularly in the context of environmental sustainability and occupational health and safety.

The company conducts proactive meetings and visits to foster relationships with the local community and participates in industrial park service centers and industry associations. This engagement is part of a broader strategy to ensure that the company’s operations do not adversely affect the local communities and to promote their welfare. Areas of focus include water management, waste reduction, and occupational health and safety training, which indirectly support community development by enhancing local quality of life and environmental conditions.

However, the report does not present specific measurable impacts related to educational initiatives, healthcare, or infrastructure development. Instead, it outlines a framework for stakeholder engagement, which includes gathering feedback from local communities as part of its broader sustainability strategy. This feedback loop is essential for identifying community concerns and effectively addressing them through the company’s operational practices.

In summary, while Grand Pacific Petrochemical Company acknowledges its role in community development through various engagement activities and sustainability measures, it falls short of providing specific measurable impacts related to educational, healthcare, or infrastructure initiatives in the reported material.","#### **Contributions to Community Development**

Pacific Petrochemical has established a dedicated ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Steering Committee, which serves as the highest governing body responsible for overseeing the company's sustainability efforts. This committee is led by the Chief Sustainability Officer and includes key members who are responsible for the implementation of ESG sustainable development principles. The committee regularly convenes meetings to evaluate the effectiveness of ESG initiatives and reports to the Board of Directors on significant ESG issues and the implementation effectiveness as identified by stakeholders.

The governance structure integrates ESG responsibilities at multiple levels. The ESG Steering Committee is accountable for overseeing the implementation of sustainable development policies and is tasked with appointing the Director of the ESG Committee. They also review and approve significant themes and performance metrics in the ESG report on an annual basis. This ensures that sustainability initiatives are not only implemented but are also aligned with the company's overall strategic objectives.

Additionally, the ESG Office operates under the guidance of the ESG Steering Committee and coordinates the implementation of ESG policies and activities. It employs a management model based on the ""Plan-Do-Check-Act"" framework, which involves identifying stakeholder concerns and reviewing ESG performance regularly. This systematic approach ensures that sustainability is integrated into the company's governance, with clear responsibilities assigned to various teams such as the Sustainable Governance Team, Climate Change Response and Green Sustainability Management Team, and others focusing on areas like employee care and social co-prosperity. Overall, the company's governance structure effectively embeds ESG considerations into its operations and decision-making processes, promoting a culture of sustainability throughout the organization.","#### **ESG Governance and Leadership**

(Financial Supervisory Commission.""]","Yes, the report provides details about the structure of the board of directors, emphasizing both diversity and expertise related to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices.

The corporate governance framework of Grand Pacific Petrochemical includes a board of directors with independent directors elected to form an Audit Committee that supervises the company’s business execution. Notably, the report states that the chairman of the board is a female, which highlights a commitment to gender diversity at the highest level of governance. However, it also notes that there are currently no representatives from socially vulnerable groups among the board members. 

Moreover, the directors participate in corporate governance and ESG education training sessions, conducted by recognized institutions such as the Securities and Futures Institute (SFI) and the Taiwan Corporate Governance Association (CGA). This training is crucial for enhancing their understanding of ESG issues and governance standards, ensuring that board members are well-equipped to address sustainability challenges and stakeholder concerns effectively.

Overall, the report indicates a structured approach to governance that values diversity and incorporates ESG-related expertise into its board composition and training initiatives.","#### **Board Structure and ESG Oversight**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** provides a comprehensive overview of the company's governance structure, detailing the composition and responsibilities of the Board of Directors, its committees, and its integration with ESG initiatives. Below is a structured analysis based on the report's content.

---

### **Structure of the Board of Directors**

1. **Composition and Representation:**
   - The Board of Directors consists of elected members from various investment groups, ensuring representation across key stakeholders. The Chairman is a female representative of Zhong Guan Investment Co., Ltd., reflecting some level of gender diversity.
   - There are independent directors on the Board, ensuring impartiality and independent oversight of the company's governance and performance.

2. **Expertise of Directors:**
   - Directors possess diverse academic backgrounds and professional expertise, including accounting, chemical engineering, finance, and law. This diversity supports comprehensive decision-making across operational, financial, and ESG-related domains.

---

### **ESG-Related Expertise and Responsibilities**

1. **Integration of ESG into Governance:**
   - The Board of Directors directly oversees ESG performance and sustainable governance. The establishment of the **ESG Steering Committee** under the Board highlights the integration of ESG considerations into the company's governance framework.

2. **Key ESG Oversight Roles:**
   - The ESG Steering Committee, chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer, operates as the highest advisory body for ESG matters. It reports annually to the Board of Directors on significant ESG issues, performance, and climate-related risks.

3. **Training on Governance and ESG:**
   - Directors regularly participate in governance and ESG training programs provided by the Securities and Futures Institute (SFI) and the Taiwan Corporate Governance Association (CGA). This ensures their understanding of ESG principles and their application within the company.

---

### **Strengths in Board Governance**

3. **Focus on Training:**
   - Continuous governance and ESG education for directors strengthens the Board’s ability to make informed and forward-looking decisions.

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Enhanced Diversity:**
   - While the Chairman is female, the report does not disclose broader gender or minority representation metrics. Greater diversity could enhance decision-making and reflect the company's commitment to inclusivity.

2. **Explicit ESG Expertise:**
   - While directors are trained in ESG principles, the report does not specify if any member possesses specialized ESG certifications or expertise. Adding directors with in-depth ESG knowledge could further strengthen governance.

3. **Transparency on Performance Metrics:**
   - The impact of ESG training on board performance and strategic decision-making could be elaborated for greater transparency and accountability.

The company has established a “Compliance Management Code” and implemented various measures aimed at addressing illegal and immoral behavior. These include relevant procedures for reporting, disciplinary actions, and appeals, which are part of the grievance mechanisms available for employees, communities, suppliers, and investors.

In terms of evidence of implementation, the report indicates that the company conducts training sessions on guidelines for ethical conduct, emphasizing anti-corruption policies and extending these trainings to governance levels within the organization. Furthermore, the report mentions that no ESG-related complaints were submitted by customers or suppliers during the reporting period, suggesting a level of effectiveness in their anti-corruption efforts. However, specific cases addressed or detailed outcomes achieved are not explicitly documented in the report. Instead, it emphasizes a zero-tolerance approach to corruption and the implementation of fine corporate governance and risk management systems, which are essential for ensuring compliance and integrity in operations. 

Overall, while the report outlines the framework and commitments towards anti-corruption, it lacks detailed instances of specific cases or measurable outcomes that demonstrate the effectiveness of these policies.","#### **Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** emphasizes the company's commitment to ethical corporate management and transparency in its operations. Anti-corruption policies are a cornerstone of its governance structure, supported by specific implementation mechanisms. Below is an analysis based on the evidence provided in the report.

---

### **Disclosure of Anti-Corruption Policies**

1. **Ethical Corporate Management Best Practices:**
   - The company has established the **""Ethical Corporate Management Best Practice Principles""** and a **""Compliance Management Code""** to guide its operations. These policies are aligned with the Company Act, the Securities and Exchange Act, and best governance practices for listed companies in Taiwan. They are aimed at fostering integrity and transparency across all business activities.

2. **Integration into Operational Procedures:**
   - Anti-corruption clauses are embedded into the company’s operating procedures. Employees are required to adhere to these principles, ensuring that corruption and unethical practices are systematically avoided.

---

### **Implementation Evidence**

1. **Training and Advocacy:**
   - Employees undergo educational training on ethical corporate management. This training reinforces the company’s commitment to anti-corruption and equips employees with the knowledge to adhere to its principles.

2. **Reporting Mechanisms:**
   - The company has established robust systems for reporting and addressing grievances. These include:
     - A **dedicated ESG mailbox** for whistleblowers.
     - Promises to protect whistleblowers and investigate reported violations diligently.

3. **Review Systems:**
   - The company regularly reviews its **""Corporate Mission, Vision, and Values""** to ensure alignment with ethical standards. These reviews are integral to the annual performance appraisal for employees, further embedding anti-corruption measures into the organizational culture.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Evidence of Outcomes:**
   - While the policies and mechanisms are robust, the report does not disclose specific cases of corruption addressed or outcomes achieved in 2023. Including such evidence would enhance transparency and stakeholder trust.

2. **Quantifiable Impact Metrics:**
   - The company could provide data on the number of corruption-related grievances received, resolved, or under investigation to quantify its anti-corruption efforts.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** demonstrates a strong commitment to anti-corruption through comprehensive policies, training programs, and reporting mechanisms. These efforts reflect a proactive stance on ethical governance.
