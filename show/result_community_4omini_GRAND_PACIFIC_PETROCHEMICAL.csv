### **Quantifiable Data on Carbon Emissions**

1. **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions:**
   - The report discloses the company’s efforts to inventory its **Scope 1 (direct emissions)** and **Scope 2 (indirect emissions from energy consumption)**. These emissions are integral to the company’s overarching goal of achieving a **45% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030** and reaching **net-zero emissions by 2050**.
   - The carbon inventory data specifically pertains to the **Kaohsiung plant**, highlighting the company’s targeted approach to managing emissions at a major operational site. However, specific numerical values for annual Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are not included in the accessible portions of the report.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions:**
   - There is no explicit mention or quantification of **Scope 3 emissions**, which include upstream and downstream activities such as supply chain emissions, product use-phase emissions, or end-of-life emissions. This omission limits the report’s comprehensiveness in addressing the full carbon footprint.

---

### **Verification by Third Parties**

1. **Independent Verification:**
   - The report states that the carbon inventory data for the Kaohsiung plant has been **independently verified by SGS**, a globally recognized third-party assurance provider. This verification enhances the credibility and reliability of the emissions data.

2. **Alignment with Standards:**
   - The report aligns with established frameworks such as the **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)** and incorporates principles from the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**. While these frameworks provide guidance for emissions reporting, the inclusion of verified data aligns with global best practices.

---

### **Strengths in Carbon Emissions Reporting**

1. **Focus on Direct Emissions:**
   - The emphasis on **Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions** demonstrates the company’s commitment to addressing the most immediate sources of its carbon footprint.

2. **Third-party Verification:**
   - The independent verification by **SGS** lends credibility to the carbon inventory data, ensuring stakeholders that the data is accurate and in compliance with international standards.

3. **Clear Reduction Targets:**
   - The company has established clear and measurable reduction goals (e.g., **45% reduction by 2030**), which provide a framework for tracking progress in future reports.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Quantitative Data Transparency:**
   - The report does not provide specific numerical values for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which limits stakeholders’ ability to assess the company’s baseline and track year-over-year progress.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions Coverage:**
   - The report should include a more detailed analysis of **Scope 3 emissions**, as these often constitute a significant portion of a company’s total carbon footprint. This would align with the growing emphasis on comprehensive value chain emissions reporting.

3. **Detailed Metrics and Trends:**
   - Including historical emissions data and year-over-year trends in a graphical format would improve transparency and allow stakeholders to evaluate progress against stated targets.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** addresses **Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions** with a focus on operational-level data and third-party verification. While the inclusion of verified carbon inventory data enhances the report’s reliability, the lack of numerical values and limited coverage of **Scope 3 emissions** represents an area for improvement.
