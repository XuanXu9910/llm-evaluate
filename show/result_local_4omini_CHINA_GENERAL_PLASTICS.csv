The ESG report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC) adheres to several internationally recognized frameworks for sustainability reporting, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). 

### Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

The GRI is a prominent framework that provides comprehensive guidelines for sustainability reporting. CGPC utilizes the GRI Universal Standards and GRI Guidelines to structure its ESG reporting, ensuring that it addresses relevant environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues effectively. This adherence promotes transparency and accountability in CGPC's sustainability practices [Data: Entities (31, 544, 632); Relationships (1248, 280)].

### Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)

CGPC also incorporates the SASB framework, specifically utilizing the SASB Indicator RT-CH-150a.1 to measure and report on its sustainability performance, particularly in waste management and water usage. This framework helps CGPC align its reporting with industry-specific sustainability accounting standards, enhancing the relevance and comparability of its ESG disclosures [Data: Entities (801); Relationships (380)].

### Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

Additionally, CGPC prepares a TCFD Report, which focuses on the financial impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities. This framework is essential for organizations looking to disclose their climate-related financial risks in a structured manner, aligning with global best practices in sustainability reporting [Data: Entities (1526); Relationships (3688)].

## Alignment with Frameworks

CGPC's ESG report demonstrates a strong alignment with these frameworks. By following the GRI standards, CGPC ensures that its reporting is comprehensive and addresses key sustainability issues relevant to its operations. The integration of SASB indicators allows for a focused assessment of specific sustainability metrics, while the TCFD framework enhances the report's robustness regarding climate-related disclosures.

The ESG report of CGPC not only complies with these internationally recognized frameworks but also reflects a commitment to best practices in sustainability reporting. This alignment is crucial for stakeholders, as it provides a clear and structured overview of the company's sustainability efforts and performance metrics [Data: Entities (2, 2534); Relationships (1, 316)].

In summary, CGPC's ESG report is well-structured according to GRI, SASB, and TCFD frameworks, ensuring that it meets international standards for sustainability reporting and effectively communicates the company's commitment to responsible and sustainable practices.","### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC)**

The organizational scope and time frame of the report are essential components that provide clarity on what is being covered. In the context of the reports produced by the Company, it is evident that there is a structured approach to defining these elements.

#### Time Frame

The reports, particularly the **Annual Report** and **Sustainability Report**, are published annually, summarizing the Company's performance and sustainability efforts over the past year. For instance, the **2023 Business Report** outlines the Company's achievements and performance metrics for the year 2023 [Data: Reports (2848); Relationships (37, 1256)].

#### Organizational Scope

Regarding the organizational scope, the reports do not explicitly detail the specific subsidiaries or supply chains included. However, it is noted that the Company operates within the petrochemical industry and has various subsidiaries, such as **CGPC Polymer** and **Taiwan VCM Corporation**, which contribute to its overall operations and sustainability initiatives [Data: Relationships (2119, 1521)]. 

The **Sustainability Report** emphasizes the Company's commitment to comprehensive emissions tracking, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, which suggests an acknowledgment of the broader operational context, including supply chains [Data: Relationships (655, 1289)]. However, the specific parts of the company included in the report are not explicitly enumerated.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the time frame of the reports is clearly defined as annual, the organizational scope could benefit from more explicit details regarding the specific subsidiaries and supply chains included in the reporting framework. This would enhance transparency and provide stakeholders with a clearer understanding of the Company's operational boundaries and sustainability commitments.","### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame in the ESG Report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC)**

The Company has implemented several policies and initiatives aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within its workforce. A key component of these efforts is the **Diversity Policy for Board Members**, which focuses on enhancing the composition of the Board of Directors by increasing the number of independent director seats and emphasizing diverse expertise. This policy is designed to ensure that the board reflects a wide range of perspectives and capabilities, ultimately contributing to more effective governance and decision-making [Data: Entities (686); Relationships (1564, 1565)].

### Gender Diversity Initiatives

The Company is particularly focused on **gender diversity**, with specific initiatives aimed at increasing the representation of female directors on its Board. This aligns with broader goals of promoting gender equality within the workplace. The **Gender Equality** initiatives are designed to foster a healthy work environment and prevent sexual harassment, ensuring that all employees are treated fairly and equitably [Data: Entities (684, 2193); Relationships (2927, 2266)].

### Compliance with Standards

In addition to internal policies, the Company adheres to the **GRI 405:2016** standard, which emphasizes the importance of diversity and equal opportunities in corporate governance and employee demographics. This standard guides the organization in its efforts to create inclusive environments and is supported by data on gender distribution and turnover rates [Data: Entities (648, 645); Relationships (328)].

### Employee Representation Data

The Company actively monitors and reports on employee demographics, including gender representation. The **Employee Data** compiled by the Personnel Section includes statistics on gender distribution, which is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of DEI initiatives. This data is essential for understanding the current state of diversity within the organization and identifying areas for improvement [Data: Entities (2039); Relationships (913)].

### Commitment to Social Inclusion

Social inclusion is a fundamental aspect of the Company's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) strategy. The organization is committed to ensuring that all individuals, particularly marginalized groups, have equitable access to resources and opportunities. This commitment is reflected in various initiatives aimed at integrating community needs and perspectives into its operational strategies [Data: Entities (21); Relationships (201)].

### Conclusion

Overall, the Company's policies and initiatives for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion are comprehensive and supported by specific data on employee demographics. By focusing on gender diversity, adhering to established standards, and committing to social inclusion, the Company aims to create a more equitable workplace that values diversity and fosters a culture of inclusion. These efforts are crucial for enhancing employee satisfaction and engagement, ultimately contributing to the organization's overall success.","### **Evaluation of Policies and Initiatives for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in the CGPC ESG Report**

The ESG report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC) provides information on its policies and initiatives to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The company highlights a structured approach to fostering employee development, gender diversity, and inclusive workplace practices. However, there is room for improvement in disclosing specific data on minority representation and broader diversity metrics.

---

### **Policies and Initiatives Supporting DEI**

1. **Gender Diversity:**
   - CGPC is actively pursuing gender diversity within its Board of Directors. In 2024, the addition of **Ms. Chen-Ming Chang** as an independent director marked a step toward gender diversity, supporting the company’s goal of ensuring diverse perspectives at the leadership level.
   - The company acknowledges the traditionally male-dominated nature of the petrochemical industry and aims to increase female representation in various roles.

2. **Training and Development:**
   - CGPC implements **diversity-focused training programs**, which include leadership development and skills enhancement initiatives for employees across all levels. In 2023, female employees participated in specific training sessions, slightly increasing their average training hours compared to their male counterparts.
   - Total training hours reached **21,666.5 hours** in 2023, with an average of **25.2 hours per employee**, demonstrating the company’s commitment to employee growth.

3. **Inclusive Policies:**
   - The company has established a **Sexual Harassment Complaint Handling Committee** and implemented a zero-tolerance policy for harassment. The mechanism ensures privacy and addresses incidents with corrective measures, including employee training on sexual harassment prevention.

---

### **Workforce Demographics**

1. **Gender Representation:**
   - CGPC’s workforce is predominantly male, reflecting the labor-intensive nature of its operations. In 2023, male employees comprised approximately **90%** of the total workforce, with females making up **10%**.
   - The company acknowledges the gender imbalance and has taken steps to attract more female talent, particularly in management and technical roles.

2. **Employment Type and Locations:**
   - Employees are distributed across Taipei, Toufen, and Kaohsiung, with efforts to recruit talent from diverse academic and professional backgrounds. In 2023, **57.2%** of employees held college degrees or higher.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
1. **Proactive Governance Initiatives:** The appointment of a female independent director aligns with CGPC’s commitment to board diversity.
2. **Employee Development Programs:** Extensive training opportunities and a focus on female participation highlight CGPC’s investment in workforce empowerment.
3. **Policies Against Workplace Harassment:** Clear mechanisms for addressing harassment demonstrate a commitment to creating a safe and inclusive environment.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Expanded Diversity Metrics:** Providing data on minority representation or other dimensions of diversity beyond gender would enhance transparency.
2. **Gender Representation in Leadership:** While progress has been made, increasing female participation in senior management and technical roles remains an area for focus.
3. **Benchmarking and Goals:** Establishing measurable DEI targets and benchmarking against industry standards would provide stakeholders with a clearer understanding of CGPC’s progress.

---

### **Conclusion**

The CGPC ESG report reflects a genuine commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion through its governance initiatives, employee training programs, and anti-harassment policies. While the company has made strides in promoting gender diversity and fostering employee growth, further disclosure of broader diversity metrics and the establishment of specific DEI targets would strengthen its position as an inclusive employer.

The data provided does not explicitly mention anti-corruption policies or procedures within the reports. However, it does reference a set of measures known as ""MEASURES HANDLING REPORTING OF ILLEGAL AND UNETHICAL OR DISHONEST BEHAVIORS,"" which outlines protocols established to address and report unethical behaviors within the organization. This set of measures was approved by the board of directors and the Audit Committee, indicating a formal approach to managing unethical conduct [Data: Entities (2223); Relationships (2779)].

### Evidence of Implementation

While the data does not provide specific cases addressed or outcomes achieved regarding anti-corruption measures, it does highlight the role of the Audit Committee in overseeing the implementation of these measures. The committee is responsible for ensuring that reports of unethical behavior are managed effectively and appropriately, which suggests a framework for addressing such issues [Data: Relationships (2779)].

Additionally, the presence of compliance checks and audits indicates that there are mechanisms in place to monitor adherence to ethical standards and policies. These checks are designed to ensure compliance with human rights standards and policies, which may encompass anti-corruption efforts as part of broader ethical management practices [Data: Entities (2125); Relationships (551)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while the reports do not explicitly detail anti-corruption policies or provide specific evidence of implementation outcomes, they do indicate a structured approach to handling unethical behaviors through established measures and oversight by the Audit Committee. Further details on specific cases or outcomes would be necessary to fully assess the effectiveness of these policies in practice.","### **Evaluation of Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures in CGPC**

The 2023 ESG report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC) outlines a robust framework for promoting ethical management and anti-corruption measures. These initiatives are embedded within its governance structure, policies, and operational practices.

   - Suggestions and grievances from external stakeholders can also be submitted through dedicated channels, demonstrating CGPC’s commitment to transparency and stakeholder engagement.

3. **Training and Awareness:**
   - In 2023, CGPC organized several seminars on ethics, including topics such as insider trading, information security, and workplace misconduct prevention.

### **Implementation and Outcomes**

1. **Internal Audits and Risk Assessments:**
   - CGPC conducts internal control evaluations to assess compliance with its ethical standards, including the identification of potential risks and self-supervision mechanisms. These evaluations ensure that ethical management practices are integrated into daily operations.

2. **No Reported Cases in 2023:**
   - According to the report, CGPC did not receive any whistleblowing or grievance cases through its reporting channels in 2023.
