ESG Sustainability ReportESG Sustainability Report 2023Message from the Chairman1 About This Report3 Shared Value4 Environmental Sustainability6 Appendix5 Happy Career and Social Prosperity\f""]","The ESG Sustainability Report from San Fang Chemical Industry provides a comprehensive overview of how the company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives are integrated into its overall business strategy. The report outlines a structured approach that emphasizes the identification and management of material sustainability issues, which are deemed critical to both the company’s current status and future operations.

Firstly, the report details a systematic process for identifying material sustainability issues through various methods, including stakeholder questionnaires and discussions led by the ESG Development Committee. This process not only aligns with established frameworks such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) but also ensures that the identified issues are relevant to the company's operations and stakeholder concerns. The material topics identified—such as air pollutant management, water resource utilization, waste management, and energy consumption—are linked to the company's operational risks and opportunities, thereby creating a clear connection to the overall business strategy. 

Moreover, the report articulates that the insights gained from these sustainability assessments inform the company's risk management decisions and strategic planning. For instance, recognizing the potential impacts of climate change and resource management on operational costs underscores the urgency of integrating these ESG considerations into everyday business practices. The ESG Development Committee plays a pivotal role in this integration, as it assists the board in fulfilling its risk management responsibilities and in implementing strategic decisions that reflect the identified ESG priorities.

Additionally, the company establishes medium- and long-term goals related to these material topics, thereby creating actionable targets that guide its operations and performance evaluation. The report indicates that the management policies set forth are not merely theoretical but are intended to be practical and measurable. By aligning ESG initiatives with corporate governance and operational performance, the company ensures that its commitment to sustainability is both actionable and relevant to its business objectives.

In summary, the report effectively links ESG initiatives to the company’s overall business strategy through a structured identification process, proactive risk management, and the setting of actionable goals. This clarity in articulation demonstrates a robust commitment to integrating sustainability into the fabric of the company's operations and long-term strategy.","#### **Linking ESG Initiatives to Business Strategy**

The sections provided primarily focus on the identification and assessment of material sustainability issues, stakeholder concerns, and the company's governance practices without detailed historical comparisons.

However, the report does mention that in 2022, the ESG Development Committee reviewed the materiality analysis process, which resulted in adjustments to the sustainability topics being reported. This indicates an ongoing reflection on their sustainability practices, but it does not provide a direct comparison of performance metrics over multiple years.

In terms of transparency and meaningfulness, the report outlines a structured approach to identifying and prioritizing sustainability issues, including stakeholder engagement and alignment with recognized standards such as GRI. While the report emphasizes the importance of operational governance and stakeholder communication, the lack of explicit historical data comparisons may limit the ability to discern meaningful trends or progress over time.

Overall, while the report showcases the company's commitment to ESG principles and governance, it does not present a comprehensive historical performance analysis that could allow for robust comparisons or evaluation of trends in ESG practices.","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The ESG report for San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. provides certain historical data to highlight trends and measure progress over time. These comparisons, while meaningful in specific areas, vary in depth and transparency across the report's sections.

---

#### **Environmental Performance**

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:**
   - The report discusses the company's efforts to reduce GHG emissions through process improvements and energy conservation measures. However, it does not provide detailed year-over-year comparisons of absolute or intensity-based GHG emissions to clearly illustrate trends or progress.

2. **Energy Management:**
   - While energy conservation and the adoption of renewable energy are central to the company’s environmental initiatives, quantitative comparisons of energy consumption across years are not comprehensively detailed, limiting transparency in this area.

3. **Waste Management:**
   - The company outlines its waste reduction initiatives and discusses the environmental benefits achieved. However, historical data comparing waste generated and managed across years is not provided, reducing the ability to evaluate long-term performance.

---

#### **Social Performance**

1. **Employee Satisfaction and Training:**
   - The report includes data on employee satisfaction surveys, showing a 71.6% average satisfaction rate in 2023. While this snapshot is valuable, the absence of comparisons to previous years limits insight into whether employee sentiment has improved over time.
   - Training hours are detailed (27,563.7 hours in 2023), but historical data is not provided to contextualize this achievement.

2. **Occupational Health and Safety:**
   - The report emphasizes improvements in workplace safety but does not include historical metrics (e.g., incident rates or lost-time injury rates) to illustrate trends or the effectiveness of safety initiatives.

---

#### **Governance and Economic Performance**

1. **Financial Metrics:**
   - Historical comparisons are available for certain financial indicators, such as net operating revenue and after-tax net income. For example:
     - Net operating revenue decreased slightly from NT$10,763,499 in 2022 to NT$10,086,736 in 2023.
     - After-tax net income grew significantly from NT$470,114 in 2022 to NT$760,274 in 2023.
   - These financial comparisons provide a clear view of trends and contribute to understanding the economic sustainability of the business.

2. **Corporate Governance Metrics:**
   - The report discusses the operation of the board of directors, including meeting attendance rates and committee activities for 2023. However, there are no historical benchmarks for governance performance, which would enhance transparency.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Historical financial comparisons are included, offering insights into the company’s economic performance trends.
   - The report provides a narrative on year-over-year progress in key focus areas, such as environmental sustainability and employee satisfaction.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Include consistent historical data for environmental metrics (e.g., GHG emissions, energy usage, waste generation) to allow stakeholders to evaluate performance trends.
   - Provide year-over-year data for social indicators, such as employee satisfaction, training hours, and safety metrics, to demonstrate long-term progress.
   - Expand governance metrics to include historical data on board and committee activities for improved benchmarking.

---

#### **Conclusion**

San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.’s ESG report demonstrates some effort to compare current performance with historical data, particularly in financial metrics. However, meaningful and transparent comparisons in environmental, social, and governance aspects remain limited. Including more consistent historical data in future reports would strengthen the ability to assess the company’s progress over time and enhance the transparency of its ESG disclosures.",0.7727272727272727,0.1578947367590027,0.0,1.0,0.23,0.8270858928290239

For the year 2023, the company reported the following emissions data: 
- **Scope 1 emissions**: 2,930.60 tons
- **Scope 2 emissions**: 15,924.40 tons
- **Total emissions**: 18,855.00 tons 

The report also highlights a notable reduction in emissions over the years, with a 37% decrease in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2023 compared to 2022. The intensity of emissions was reported as 29.52 tons of CO2e per million NTD of revenue for 2023.

As for verification, the GHG emissions data for 2021 and 2022 have been verified by third parties, specifically TÜV NORD for 2021 and SGS for 2022. The verification for 2023 emissions is expected to be conducted by SGS, with completion anticipated by the end of June 2024. This third-party verification process underscores the company's commitment to transparency and accuracy in its environmental reporting. 

Additionally, the company aims to complete its data collection for Scope 3 emissions by the third quarter of 2024, which will also be verified in due course. This systematic approach to measuring and verifying emissions aligns with international standards, enhancing the credibility of the company's sustainability initiatives.","#### **Carbon Emissions Data in the Report**

The ESG report for San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. provides a narrative on the company’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and addressing climate change. However, the report does not offer detailed, quantifiable data on carbon emissions segmented by Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 categories.

---

#### **Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 Emissions**

1. **Scope 1 (Direct Emissions):**
   - The report mentions efforts to reduce GHG emissions through operational improvements and energy conservation but does not present specific numerical data for Scope 1 emissions.

2. **Scope 2 (Indirect Emissions from Energy):**
   - The report highlights the company's adoption of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures as part of its sustainability strategy. However, it does not include quantitative Scope 2 emission figures or details about electricity usage and associated emissions.

3. **Scope 3 (Value Chain Emissions):**
   - While the report references supply chain sustainability and collaboration with suppliers to promote environmentally friendly practices, it does not quantify Scope 3 emissions from the supply chain, product lifecycle, or other indirect sources.

---

#### **Third-Party Verification**

The report does not specify whether its GHG emissions data, or the lack thereof, have been verified by an independent third party. Verification is a critical component for ensuring the credibility and reliability of disclosed emissions data, which is currently absent from the report.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The report outlines the company’s commitment to climate action, including initiatives such as process improvements, energy conservation, and supplier engagement.
   - It highlights alignment with global standards, such as the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which demonstrates a forward-looking approach to emissions reduction.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Include detailed, quantifiable data on Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, supported by comprehensive methodologies for emissions calculation.
   - Seek third-party verification for the emissions data to enhance transparency and stakeholder confidence.
   - Provide year-over-year comparisons of emissions data to illustrate progress toward reduction goals.

---

#### **Conclusion**

While the ESG report for San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. emphasizes the company’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, it lacks the quantifiable emissions data necessary for a robust evaluation of its performance in this area. The absence of third-party verification further limits the reliability of the disclosures. Future reports would benefit from detailed emissions data, segmented by scope, and independent verification to align with best practices in ESG reporting.",1.0,0.3333333330555555,0.7515265562790844,1.0,0.16,0.6720085059411399

(SFC Group) are indeed science-based, as they have applied to join the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as of July 2023. This initiative requires companies to establish concrete and feasible carbon reduction targets based on a thorough carbon inventory that encompasses Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. SFC Group plans to complete this carbon inventory in 2024, set specific reduction targets by 2025, and submit these targets to the SBTi by 2026. The ultimate goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030.

The report outlines a clear timeline with milestones and deadlines to track progress effectively. Key milestones include signing a commitment letter by December 2023, initiating a group-wide organizational inventory in 2024, self-setting short-term reduction targets, and establishing long-term net-zero objectives. The timeline demonstrates a structured approach to achieving these goals, with specific actions planned for each year leading up to 2030. Additionally, the company has set a target to reduce carbon emissions by 18% by 2025, using 2018 as the base year, which reflects a strategic commitment to measurable progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 

Furthermore, SFC Group’s approach involves regular reporting and assessment to ensure that progress is monitored and communicated effectively, thereby reinforcing their commitment to environmental sustainability and accountability.","#### **Emission Reduction Targets in the Report**

The ESG report for San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. discusses the company’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as part of its sustainability initiatives. While the report mentions the alignment of its reduction efforts with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), it does not provide comprehensive details regarding specific targets, milestones, or deadlines for tracking progress.

---

#### **Science-Based Targets**

The report highlights the company’s commitment to signing the SBTi initiative, indicating its intention to align its emission reduction goals with scientifically validated pathways to limit global warming to 1.5°C or well below 2°C. This alignment demonstrates the company’s awareness of the importance of setting rigorous and credible targets. However, the following gaps were noted:

1. **Specific Targets:**
   - The report does not specify concrete emission reduction percentages or absolute targets for Scope 1, Scope 2, or Scope 3 emissions.

2. **Time-Bound Goals:**
   - While there is a mention of long-term sustainability efforts, the report does not provide clear deadlines or intermediate milestones for achieving these emission reduction goals.

3. **Detailed Strategy:**
   - The report lacks a breakdown of the actions or measures planned to meet these targets, such as renewable energy adoption, process improvements, or supply chain optimization.

---

#### **Milestones and Deadlines**

The absence of clearly defined milestones and deadlines is a notable gap. Effective tracking of progress requires time-bound objectives that enable stakeholders to assess whether the company is on track to meet its commitments. For example, companies adhering to SBTi typically outline multi-year reduction targets, such as achieving a 30% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The company demonstrates awareness of global standards by referencing its intention to align with the SBTi framework.
   - The report acknowledges the need for collaboration with suppliers and stakeholders to drive emissions reductions across the value chain.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Define specific, quantifiable emission reduction targets aligned with SBTi guidelines.
   - Include intermediate milestones and deadlines to enable progress tracking.
   - Provide a detailed strategy or roadmap outlining the measures and resources dedicated to achieving these targets.

---

#### **Conclusion**

While San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.’s ESG report reflects its commitment to science-based emission reduction frameworks such as SBTi, the lack of specific, measurable targets and time-bound milestones limits the transparency and accountability of its goals. Future reports would benefit from a detailed breakdown of science-based targets, accompanied by actionable timelines and strategies to enable stakeholders to track progress effectively.",0.8823529411764706,0.3076923074556212,0.634449744855027,1.0,0.07,0.7461937930668887

Therefore,  SFC  will  adopt  a  shadow \nprice for internal carbon pricing. The current price of 1 ton of \ncarbon is NTD 300, which will be applied to the assessment \nof carbon reduction actions for Scope 1 and 2 emissions.

The company's waste management policies are designed to comply with local laws and regulations, ensuring that all waste is reported and disposed of appropriately. They classify waste into three categories: general business waste, hazardous business waste, and recyclable waste, which facilitates targeted management approaches.

In terms of waste reduction, San Fang has set specific targets, aiming for a 2% reduction in waste by 2025, using 2018 as the base year. They have actively worked on improving processes to increase yield rates and streamline operations, contributing to a reported decrease in total industrial waste output of 2% compared to 2018. The company also employs measures to manage hazardous waste effectively, including the sorting and collection of hazardous materials in designated areas, which are then transported and disposed of by certified environmental protection companies.

The results of these waste management strategies are indeed measurable and disclosed in the report. For instance, the report provides quantitative data on the total waste generated across various factories from 2019 to 2023, including specific figures for hazardous waste and recycling rates. In 2023, the hazardous waste recycling rate was reported at 8.6%. The report also details the disposal methods for hazardous waste, indicating the proportions of incineration, physical treatment, and reuse. This transparency in reporting not only showcases the company's commitment to environmental sustainability but also allows stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of their waste management strategies.","#### **Waste Management Strategies in the Report**

The company’s approach is rooted in the practices outlined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which helps to systematically identify, evaluate, and report climate-related risks and opportunities.

To begin with, the company has established an ESG Development Committee that oversees the identification of climate-related risks and opportunities. This committee is responsible for evaluating the potential impacts of various climate scenarios on the organization’s operations and finances. The assessment process includes scenario analysis based on different climate models, such as the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios, specifically RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. These models help the company project the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as heavy rainfall and high temperatures, and estimate their financial impacts on production facilities like the Kaohsiung Factory.

The company’s risk assessment process also emphasizes collaboration across departments. Each department discusses and analyzes the likelihood and potential financial impacts of climate risks. By integrating insights from sales, legal, and operational teams, San Fang aims to create a holistic view of the risks posed by climate change. For instance, the organization assesses how regulatory changes, such as the introduction of carbon fees and renewable energy requirements, could alter operational costs and influence its strategic direction.

In terms of disclosure, the company reports its findings in its annual ESG Sustainability Report, where it details the identified climate risks, the methodologies used for assessment, and the strategies formulated in response. This includes short-, medium-, and long-term targets for mitigating risks associated with climate change, such as energy conservation initiatives and the transition to low-carbon technologies. Furthermore, the progress and effectiveness of these strategies are regularly reviewed, ensuring that the company remains responsive to evolving environmental challenges.

Overall, San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. demonstrates a proactive approach to climate risk management. By utilizing established frameworks and engaging various departments in the assessment process, the company aims to enhance its resilience to climate-related impacts while maintaining transparency with stakeholders through detailed disclosures.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

The ESG report of San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. highlights the company’s awareness of climate change as a significant factor influencing its operations and long-term strategy.

#### **Conclusion**

San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.’s ESG report reflects an awareness of the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. While it outlines governance structures and initiatives to mitigate these risks, the lack of detailed financial assessments and scenario-based disclosures limits the report's effectiveness in addressing stakeholder concerns. Future disclosures should focus on quantifying the financial implications of climate risks and providing detailed insights into the company’s adaptive strategies. This would strengthen transparency and align with leading practices in climate-related financial reporting.",1.0,0.1999999998666666,0.7499025852429108,1.0,0.26,0.8566340057641013

The company actively recruits employees through various channels, ensuring that the recruitment process is fair and open without discrimination based on age, race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or disabilities. This commitment to inclusivity is reflected in the company's adherence to the People with Disabilities Rights Protection Act, which mandates a statutory quota for hiring people with disabilities.

In terms of workforce demographics, the company provides data on gender representation within its employee base. For instance, from 2021 to 2023, the male-female ratio of new hires shows a significant gender disparity. In 2021, 98.6% of new employees were male, while only 1.4% were female, illustrating a potential area for improvement in gender equity. The trend continued in subsequent years, with 88.9% male and 11.1% female hires in 2022, and 89.8% male and 10.2% female in 2023. This data highlights the need for targeted initiatives to attract and retain female employees in the workforce.

The company has also taken steps to ensure board diversity. The Articles of Incorporation stipulate a candidate nomination system for director elections, emphasizing the importance of diverse backgrounds, skills, and experiences in board members. This includes considerations of gender, age, nationality, and professional expertise, aligning with the guidelines set out in the Corporate Governance Best Practice Principles.

Additionally, the company promotes an inclusive workplace by planning to launch an employee assistance program (EAP) aimed at providing psychological counseling and support for employees. This program is part of a broader strategy to enhance employee retention and motivation, indicating a commitment to fostering a supportive and inclusive work environment.

Overall, while San Fang Chemical has established policies aimed at promoting DEI, the gender representation data suggests that there is room for improvement, particularly in achieving a more balanced workforce. The company's ongoing initiatives and future plans will be crucial in advancing these goals and enhancing overall diversity and inclusion within the organization.","#### **Policies and Initiatives for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**

The ESG report of San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. demonstrates the company's commitment to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within its workforce. This is evident through its adherence to non-discrimination policies and efforts to ensure equal opportunities for all employees.

---

#### **Diversity and Inclusion Policies**

1. **Non-Discrimination Policy:**
   - The company explicitly states its commitment to non-discrimination in hiring and workplace practices.

This policy is enforced through fair and open recruitment procedures and regular monitoring.

2. **Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities:**
   - In compliance with the **People with Disabilities Rights Protection Act**, San Fang Chemical employs persons with disabilities and assigns them roles appropriate to their abilities.

   - The company strictly prohibits forced labor and child labor, as outlined in its ""Personnel Management Regulations."" Hiring processes include stringent checks to ensure compliance with these standards.

---

#### **Representation Data**

1. **Gender Representation:**
   - The report discloses that the company employed a total of 577 individuals in Taiwan in 2023, of which 83% were male and 17% were female. This gender imbalance is attributed to the nature of the industry. Although the report provides this breakdown, there is no mention of specific initiatives aimed at improving gender diversity.

2. **Age Distribution:**
   - The majority of employees (37%) fall within the 40-50 age range. The company provides detailed age group data, indicating transparency but does not link these figures to targeted initiatives to enhance age diversity.

---

#### **Key Initiatives**

1. **Freedom of Association:**
   - Employees are encouraged to form and join associations freely, reinforcing the company’s commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace.

2. **Social and Labor Convergence Project (SLCP):**
   - Since 2020, San Fang Chemical has participated in third-party verifications under the SLCP framework, which evaluates labor conditions. This initiative enhances transparency and supports the continuous improvement of labor rights and conditions.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Clear non-discrimination and equal opportunity policies.
   - Compliance with statutory requirements for hiring persons with disabilities.
   - Participation in third-party verifications to enhance labor rights transparency.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Introduce measurable goals and initiatives to address gender imbalances.

---

#### **Conclusion**

San Fang Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.’s policies reflect a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, especially regarding non-discrimination and the inclusion of persons with disabilities. However, the absence of targeted strategies to address gender and age diversity presents an opportunity for improvement. Future reports could benefit from setting measurable goals and demonstrating progress through more detailed data and initiatives.",0.9615384615384616,0.3076923074556212,0.6636364568736242,1.0,0.39,0.8609142506984773
