Notably, the report aligns with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, specifically GRI 1: Foundation 2021 and GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021. The GRI framework is widely acknowledged for its comprehensive approach to sustainability reporting, focusing on economic, environmental, and social impacts. In this report, TTET Union Corp. emphasizes the importance of materiality analysis, identifying significant sustainability topics that affect stakeholders and the organization itself.

In addition to GRI, the report also follows the principles set by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The SASB provides sector-specific standards to help businesses disclose material sustainability information relevant to investors, while the TCFD focuses on the governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics related to climate-related risks and opportunities. TTET Union Corp. explicitly states its compliance with the TCFD framework, demonstrating its commitment to addressing climate change impacts in its business strategy and operations.

The alignment of the TTET Union Corp. report with these frameworks is evident in its structured approach to reporting. The company has conducted a rigorous materiality analysis, identifying 16 major sustainability topics that are disclosed in accordance with GRI's requirements. Furthermore, the report discusses governance practices, risk management processes, and metrics used to assess climate-related risks, as recommended by TCFD guidelines. Overall, the report reflects a commitment to transparency and responsible corporate governance, making it a reliable source of information for stakeholders interested in the company’s sustainability performance.","### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report of TTET Union Corporation**

#### **Defined Scope of the Report**
The TTET Union Corporation ESG report provides a clear definition of its organizational scope, specifying that the report covers the sustainability performance of TTET Union Corporation as an individual entity. This ensures clarity for stakeholders about the specific aspects of the company being evaluated.

- The report includes data primarily from TTET Union Corporation itself, with most indicators reflecting internal operations. It explicitly notes that the statistical data disclosed are the results of internal surveys and calculations.
- Regarding subsidiaries or supply chain elements, the report mentions that data from the company’s subsidiaries or supply chains are not the primary focus unless specified. For example, supply chain management and supplier environmental and social assessments are discussed, but operational data focus on TTET Union Corporation's direct activities.

#### **Time Frame of the Report**
The time frame covered by the report is explicitly stated as January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. Additionally, the report indicates that for certain material issues, data from periods prior to 2023 or beyond may also be included to provide completeness in disclosure.

- The report clearly differentiates between the reporting period and previous reports, stating there are no significant differences in scope or restatements compared to the 2022 report. This consistency ensures stakeholders can effectively compare performance across reporting periods.

#### **Inclusion of Subsidiaries and Supply Chain**
While the report primarily focuses on TTET Union Corporation, it touches on supply chain elements in specific contexts, such as:
- **Supplier Management Policies:** The report highlights evaluations and quality control measures for suppliers, particularly in sourcing raw materials like soybeans and packaging materials.
- **Sustainability Assurance Protocol:** The company collaborates with U.S. soybean suppliers under the Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol (SSAP), integrating sustainability considerations into its supply chain practices.

#### **Strengths in Scope Definition**
1. **Clear Organizational Boundaries:** By limiting the scope primarily to TTET Union Corporation, the report provides precise and focused disclosures, avoiding ambiguities about the entities included.
2. **Defined Time Frame:** The consistent application of a clear reporting period enables stakeholders to track year-over-year performance effectively.

#### **Areas for Improvement**
1. **Subsidiary Inclusion:** The report could benefit from more detailed disclosures about subsidiaries like Master Channels Corporation, which contributes to food distribution and wholesale operations.
2. **Supply Chain Transparency:** Expanding the depth of disclosures on the environmental and social impacts of supply chain operations would strengthen the report’s comprehensiveness.

### **Conclusion**
The TTET Union Corporation ESG report effectively defines its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring stakeholders can clearly understand the coverage of its disclosures. However, further elaboration on subsidiary contributions and deeper insights into supply chain sustainability impacts could enhance the report’s transparency and utility.",0.5,0.2222222219753086,0.0,1.0,0.62,0.8136601303968003

#### **Integration of ESG into Business Strategy**

TTET Union Corporation integrates its ESG initiatives into its core business strategy in several actionable ways:

1. **Sustainability Governance:**

2. **Materiality-Driven Priorities:**
   - The report identifies 16 material ESG topics, such as economic performance, occupational health and safety, climate-related financial impacts, and waste management. These topics are used to guide the company’s operational priorities and align ESG objectives with strategic business goals.

3. **Risk Management and Resilience:**
   - ESG initiatives, such as climate-related risk management and food safety programs, are directly linked to mitigating operational risks. For example, the company’s measures to address climate-related risks include establishing a greenhouse gas inventory and adopting renewable energy solutions, which support both sustainability goals and cost efficiencies.

---

#### **Examples of Alignment in Key Areas**

1. **Environmental Initiatives:**
   - **Energy and Carbon Management:** The company’s adoption of ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) and ISO 50001 (Energy Management) systems reflects a commitment to reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. These efforts align with its strategic goal of maintaining cost competitiveness while addressing environmental impacts.
   - **Waste Reduction:** Innovations in lightweight packaging and recycling align with TTET Union Corporation’s business objective to reduce operational costs while minimizing environmental impact.

2. **Product Responsibility:**
   - **Food Safety:** The alignment of food safety certifications (ISO 22000, HACCP, and FSSC 22000) with product differentiation strategies demonstrates how the company leverages ESG initiatives to maintain market trust and expand its competitive edge.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - Through structured communication channels with stakeholders such as employees, customers, and suppliers, the company aligns its social responsibility goals with its business objectives of enhancing customer satisfaction and supplier relationships.

The report clearly articulates how specific ESG initiatives contribute to actionable business outcomes:
- **Short-Term Goals:** These include strengthening raw material quality control and expanding niche product sales, supported by robust sustainability practices in procurement and quality assurance.
- **Long-Term Goals:** The report outlines strategic objectives such as entering new markets in Asia and investing in regional oil plants. These objectives are supported by ESG initiatives like training employees for global competitiveness and implementing renewable energy systems to comply with evolving regulations.

However, the report could enhance its clarity by providing more measurable targets and timelines to track the implementation and impact of these ESG-business alignments.

The report primarily focuses on the company's sustainability performance for the reporting period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, and while it acknowledges previous reporting years, it does not provide a detailed comparison of historical data.

The report states that it aims for completeness in information disclosure, and certain sections may include data from before 2022 or from 2023 for specific material issues. However, the text does not present a systematic analysis or visual representation (like graphs or tables) that would typically accompany historical comparisons to illustrate progress over time. 

In terms of transparency, the report is structured according to the latest GRI Standards and adheres to regulatory guidelines from the Taiwan Stock Exchange. This framework suggests a robust foundation for reporting, but the lack of explicit historical comparisons may limit the report’s ability to effectively communicate trends or improvements in ESG performance. Therefore, while the report is generally transparent in its methodology and adherence to standards, the absence of meaningful historical data comparisons may reduce the clarity of the company's progress in sustainability efforts over time.","### **Analysis of ESG Performance Data Comparison in the TTET Union Corporation ESG Report**

#### **Inclusion of Historical Data for Performance Comparison**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report incorporates historical data in several areas, providing a basis for tracking progress and identifying trends over time. These comparisons are presented transparently and focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) across environmental, social, and governance dimensions.

1. **Environmental Performance:**
   - The report provides data on energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and waste reduction measures. For example, the total energy savings in 2023 were reported as approximately 551.69 kWh, resulting in an estimated reduction of 272,535 kg of CO2e emissions. Although the report outlines this achievement, a detailed year-over-year comparison of energy efficiency or emissions reductions would enhance visibility into long-term trends.

2. **Economic Performance:**
   - Financial data, including operating revenue, costs, and pre-tax profits, are compared over three years (2021-2023). For example, the report highlights a decrease in operating revenue from NT$20.217 billion in 2022 to NT$18.488 billion in 2023, attributing the decline to reduced market demand and macroeconomic challenges.

3. **Food Safety and Product Quality:**
   - Certifications such as ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 are linked to product quality metrics. The report mentions that 97.06% of the net sales in 2023 came from products manufactured under certified systems, but historical comparisons for these certifications are not detailed, limiting trend analysis.

4. **Social Contributions:**
   - Workforce data, such as employee nationality (100% local employees in 2023) and the absence of foreign workers, are consistent year-over-year. However, metrics related to employee diversity, talent cultivation, or workplace satisfaction do not include historical trends.

---

#### **Meaningfulness of Comparisons**

The comparisons presented in the report are meaningful in several areas but could be enhanced to provide deeper insights:

1. **Strengths:**
   - Multi-year financial data enable stakeholders to assess economic resilience and identify trends in profitability and revenue performance.
   - Environmental performance metrics, such as energy savings and GHG reductions, demonstrate incremental progress toward sustainability goals.

2. **Areas for Enhancement:**
   - The report does not consistently use visual tools like graphs or tables to illustrate trends, which could improve accessibility and clarity.
   - Comparisons for social and governance metrics, such as employee engagement, diversity, or governance effectiveness, are limited or absent.

---

#### **Transparency in Reporting**

The report ensures transparency by disclosing the basis for its data and clarifying methodologies. For example, financial data is derived from audited financial statements, while environmental metrics are tied to ISO standards. Limited assurance by PwC Taiwan further enhances credibility. However, the lack of clear baseline data for some ESG initiatives, such as waste management or supplier compliance, reduces the ability to track progress comprehensively.

---

### **Conclusion**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report provides some comparisons of current performance with historical data, primarily in financial and environmental areas. While these comparisons are meaningful and transparent, expanding the scope of historical data across all ESG dimensions and visualizing trends would significantly enhance stakeholder understanding. Consistent inclusion of year-over-year data for social and governance metrics would also support a more holistic assessment of the company’s sustainability progress.",0.3571428571428571,0.124999999921875,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.35,0.8196254873897741

This framework emphasizes four key areas: Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets.

In terms of governance, the Corporate Sustainable Development Management Organization is responsible for identifying and evaluating climate-related risks and opportunities. This organization collaborates with relevant departments to formulate response strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change on operations. The Board of Directors receives annual reports detailing the assessment outcomes and the implemented strategies, ensuring oversight and governance at the highest level.

The company categorizes climate-related risks into two main types: transition risks, which are associated with the shift towards a low-carbon economy, and physical risks, which stem from the direct impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events. For example, the company acknowledges regulatory risks, such as carbon taxes and renewable energy requirements, which can increase operational costs. In response, it has formulated specific strategies, such as purchasing renewable energy and implementing energy-saving measures, to mitigate these risks.

Operationally, the company has established protocols for managing the potential impacts of extreme weather, including purchasing property insurance to cover potential losses from natural disasters and setting up emergency response plans. The assessment of risks includes analyzing the likelihood of occurrence and the potential financial impacts, enabling the company to develop robust response strategies. The integration of these assessments into the overall risk management system ensures that climate-related risks are considered alongside other operational risks, facilitating a comprehensive approach to corporate governance and sustainability.

Furthermore, the company maintains a greenhouse gas inventory and sets reduction goals, which are regularly reviewed against established metrics. This process not only aids in compliance with regulatory requirements but also helps the company track its performance in managing climate-related risks and opportunities effectively. Overall, the company's approach to climate risk assessment and disclosure reflects a commitment to transparency and sustainability in its operations.","### **Analysis of Climate-Related Financial and Operational Risk Assessment in the TTET Union Corporation ESG Report**

This organization was authorized by the Board of Directors and is responsible for integrating and planning the company’s sustainable development activities across various dimensions, including corporate governance, labor and human rights, environmental protection, energy conservation, and social welfare.

#### **Dedicated Governance Structure for Sustainability**

TTET Union Corporation has established a robust governance framework to oversee its sustainability efforts, demonstrating its commitment to integrating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) principles into its operational and strategic processes.

1. **Sustainable Development Management Organization (SDMO):**
   - The SDMO is the dedicated body responsible for the company's sustainability initiatives. Originally established in 2014 as the Corporate Social Responsibility Management Organization, it was renamed in 2023 to reflect the evolving focus on sustainability. The SDMO is tasked with promoting sustainable development activities across areas such as corporate governance, labor and human rights, environmental protection, energy conservation, and social welfare.

2. **Leadership and Integration:**
   - The SDMO operates under the leadership of a convener, who is responsible for integrating and planning the company's sustainability strategies. The organization reports to the Board of Directors annually, ensuring high-level oversight and alignment with corporate goals.

3. **Specialized Focus Areas:**
   - The SDMO is structured into various sub-teams, each focusing on specific sustainability topics, including corporate governance, labor and human rights, supply chain management, product liability, occupational safety, environmental protection, energy conservation, and climate change.

---

#### **Integration into Governance Structures**

1. **Board-Level Oversight:**
   - The Board of Directors is the highest governing body overseeing sustainability and ethical corporate management. By receiving annual updates from the SDMO, the board ensures that sustainability efforts are aligned with the company’s broader strategic objectives.

2. **Committees Supporting Governance:**
   - In addition to the SDMO, TTET Union Corporation has established specialized committees such as the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee. These committees enhance governance quality by providing independent oversight and ensuring accountability in financial, ethical, and strategic operations.

3. **Transparency and Accountability:**
   - The company values operational transparency and publishes detailed reports on sustainability initiatives. The availability of English-language versions of corporate governance information and sustainability reports further reflects its commitment to global stakeholder engagement.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Clear delineation of responsibilities within the SDMO ensures comprehensive coverage of key sustainability topics.
   - Annual reporting to the Board of Directors reflects strong governance integration and accountability.
   - Structured committees and policies strengthen oversight mechanisms.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Performance Metrics:** While governance structures are robust, reporting on the outcomes of these governance efforts (e.g., specific sustainability achievements) could provide greater transparency.
   - **Broader Stakeholder Representation:** Including stakeholder input directly in board-level discussions could further align sustainability initiatives with external expectations.

---

### **Conclusion**

TTET Union Corporation demonstrates a well-structured approach to governing sustainability efforts, with clear accountability and integration into its governance framework. The Sustainable Development Management Organization plays a pivotal role in driving these efforts, while the Board of Directors ensures alignment with strategic goals.

The Board of Directors consists of 11 members, all of whom possess extensive business management experience. While the report does not provide detailed statistics on the diversity of the board members regarding gender, skills, tenure, and age, it indicates that this information can be found in specified sections of the 2023 Annual Report. This suggests a commitment to transparency regarding the board's composition.

Furthermore, the report emphasizes the importance of the directors' knowledge and insights in fostering the company’s sustainable operations. The establishment of committees such as the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee, which include independent directors, also points to a structure that promotes accountability and oversight, critical components of effective governance. The existence of the “Board Performance Evaluation Guideline” further reinforces the Board's commitment to evaluating its performance and effectiveness annually, which is essential for maintaining high standards in corporate governance and ESG-related initiatives.

In summary, while specific diversity metrics are not directly disclosed in the report, the overall governance structure, including the emphasis on independent oversight and the annual performance evaluations, suggests a board that is competent in managing ESG-related issues. For precise details on diversity metrics, stakeholders are encouraged to refer to the mentioned sections of the Annual Report.","### **Analysis of Board of Directors Structure in TTET Union Corporation**

It mentions that the company has established various mechanisms for reporting unethical behavior, which include channels for employees and stakeholders to raise concerns regarding integrity issues. These structures are intended to ensure that any unethical conduct, such as bribery or fraud, can be reported confidentially and addressed effectively.

Furthermore, the report outlines the procedures for handling reports of unethical behavior. It details how allegations are investigated, the feedback provided to whistleblowers, and the punitive measures that can be taken against violators of the company's ethical standards. Notably, whistleblowers are assured protection and potential rewards for verified reports, which incentivizes the reporting of corruption and misconduct.

However, while the report describes the policies and procedures in place, it does not provide specific evidence of implementation, such as detailed cases addressed or outcomes achieved related to these anti-corruption measures. The absence of concrete examples makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of these policies in practice. Thus, while the framework is robust, the report lacks documented instances of enforcement or metrics that would illustrate the outcomes of the anti-corruption efforts.","### **Analysis of Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures in TTET Union Corporation**
