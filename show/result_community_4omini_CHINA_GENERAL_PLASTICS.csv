Each of these frameworks serves distinct purposes but collectively enhances the overall transparency and accountability of sustainability reporting.

The GRI is a cornerstone for sustainability reporting, providing comprehensive guidelines that organizations follow to communicate their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impacts. The GRI Universal Standards 2021 are designed to align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), promoting a cohesive approach to sustainability that addresses critical global challenges. Organizations, including China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC), utilize GRI standards to foster transparency and accountability in their sustainability practices. 

SASB complements GRI by developing industry-specific sustainability accounting standards that provide investors with decision-useful information. This framework helps organizations disclose material information tailored to their respective sectors, ensuring that their sustainability metrics are relevant and applicable. The alignment of SASB standards with the reporting practices of organizations like CGPC is crucial for enhancing corporate accountability and meeting investor expectations.

Furthermore, the TCFD framework offers guidelines for companies to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities. By adopting TCFD's structure, organizations can better assess and communicate how climate change might impact their operations and financial performance. This integration is essential for promoting informed decision-making among stakeholders and investors.

In terms of alignment, the ESG report prepared by CGPC demonstrates a strong commitment to adhering to these frameworks.
