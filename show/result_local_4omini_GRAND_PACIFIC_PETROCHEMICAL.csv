### Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)

In addition to GRI, the ESG report incorporates SASB standards, which focus on providing guidelines that help businesses disclose material sustainability information to investors. SASB standards are particularly relevant for publicly-listed companies and are designed to ensure that the information disclosed is decision-useful for investors. Grand Pacific Petrochemical adheres to SASB standards to enhance its sustainability accounting practices, particularly in the chemicals industry [Data: Entities (38, 237); Relationships (286, 492)].

The Corporate ESG Steering Committee oversees the integration of these frameworks into the reporting process, ensuring that the report is comprehensive and adheres to recognized standards [Data: Relationships (13, 603, 604)].

Moreover, the ESG report includes themes and metrics that are consistent with the GRI and SASB standards, such as emissions reporting, energy consumption, and labor rights. This alignment not only enhances the credibility of the report but also facilitates stakeholder engagement by providing relevant and comparable information [Data: Relationships (31, 455, 457)].

The report provides a comprehensive overview of the organization's sustainability efforts, including its operational review, environmental sustainability, and labor rights. However, the specific organizational scope and time frame are not explicitly detailed in the provided data. The ""Reporting Period"" section indicates that it refers to the specific timeframe during which the company's operational activities and performance are assessed for the sustainability report [Data: Entities (65); Relationships (627)]. 

### Inclusion of Company Parts

Regarding the inclusion of various parts of the company, such as subsidiaries and supply chains, the data does not specify which specific entities or segments are covered in the report. While the report discusses the company's overall strategies and commitments, it lacks detailed information on whether it encompasses subsidiaries, supply chains, or other operational segments. The absence of this information suggests that the report may address the organization in a more general context without delineating the specific components involved [Data: Entities (1550); Relationships (14)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while the report outlines significant aspects of the organization's sustainability practices and operational reviews, it does not clearly define the organizational scope or specify the parts of the company included in the report. This lack of detail may limit stakeholders' understanding of the full extent of the organization's sustainability efforts and the specific areas being reported on. Further clarification in future reports could enhance transparency and stakeholder engagement.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame in the ESG Report**

   - While the report mentions **supplier sustainability management**, it lacks detailed disclosure on upstream supply chain impacts, such as emissions or material sourcing. Expanding this section would enhance the completeness of the organizational scope.

2. **Downstream Impact Analysis:**
   - A more detailed evaluation of downstream impacts, such as product end-of-life management or customer use-phase emissions, could strengthen the report’s comprehensiveness.

The provided data does not explicitly mention whether the report compares current ESG performance data with historical data to highlight progress or trends over time. However, it does indicate that the ESG Report serves as a comprehensive document that outlines the company's sustainability practices and performance metrics, which could imply a potential for such comparisons. The report is designed to communicate the organization's commitment to sustainability and responsible governance, and it is reviewed by the ESG Steering Committee and the Board of Directors, which suggests a level of oversight that could enhance the transparency of the information presented [Data: Entities (50, 0); Relationships (607, 602)].

### Transparency and Meaningfulness of Comparisons

While the data does not provide specific details on the methodology for comparing current and historical ESG performance, it does highlight the importance of stakeholder feedback in refining future reports. This feedback mechanism could contribute to the meaningfulness and transparency of any comparisons made, as it ensures that the report aligns with stakeholder expectations and concerns [Data: Relationships (15)]. 

Moreover, the report is likely to reference established frameworks such as the GRI Standards, which promote transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting. These standards guide organizations in effectively communicating their performance related to ESG issues, potentially including historical comparisons if they are deemed relevant [Data: Relationships (30, 463, 488)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while the data does not confirm the presence of historical comparisons in the ESG report, it does suggest that the report is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's ESG performance. The involvement of oversight committees and adherence to recognized reporting standards may enhance the transparency and meaningfulness of any comparisons made. However, without specific references to historical data comparisons, it remains unclear how effectively these trends are highlighted in the report.","#### **Comparison of Current ESG Performance with Historical Data**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** incorporates some comparisons of ESG performance data with historical data to showcase progress and trends over time. However, the depth and scope of these comparisons vary across different ESG dimensions. Below is an evaluation of how effectively the report presents these comparisons and whether they provide meaningful insights.

---

### **Environmental Data**

1. **Carbon Emissions and Energy Use:**
   - The report highlights significant goals, such as a **45% carbon emissions reduction by 2030** and **net-zero emissions by 2050**, using 2015 as the baseline. However, it does not provide detailed historical data for annual emissions, energy use, or renewable energy deployment, which limits the ability to assess year-over-year progress quantitatively.
   - The carbon inventory data for the **Kaohsiung plant**, verified by **SGS**, is a positive step in ensuring the reliability of reported figures, but trends over multiple years are not extensively detailed.

2. **Resource Management:**
   - Efforts to increase water recycling ratios and reduce waste generation are mentioned, but without specific historical or baseline data, the trends in performance over time are not transparent.

---

### **Social Data**

1. **Employee Welfare and Safety:**
   - The report mentions objectives for enhancing occupational safety and reducing workplace accidents through the **ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System**. However, it does not provide historical metrics such as past accident rates or trends in safety performance.

2. **Talent Development:**
   - There is mention of ongoing training and employee retention strategies, but again, without historical metrics (e.g., training hours or retention rates), it is difficult to evaluate progress in these areas.

---

### **Governance Data**

1. **Anti-Corruption and Ethical Practices:**
   - The report emphasizes its zero-tolerance policy for corruption and provides information on training conducted to strengthen ethical awareness. However, there is no comparison of past incidents, compliance breaches, or training participation rates.

2. **Corporate Governance:**
   - Governance-related improvements, such as the establishment of the **Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)** and the **ESG Steering Committee**, are noted as key milestones. While these indicate progress, historical data comparing past governance structures or achievements in oversight is absent.

---

### **Economic Performance**

1. **Financial Metrics:**
   - The report provides a clear comparison of financial performance for **2022 and 2023**, including operating revenue, gross profit, and net income. For instance, **operating revenue decreased by NT$2.46 billion**, and the company’s consolidated net loss after tax increased significantly to **NT$1.46 billion in 2023** from **NT$454 million in 2022**. These comparisons are transparent and highlight the financial challenges faced by the company over the past year.

---

### **Strengths in Historical Comparisons**

1. **Financial Data Transparency:**
   - The report’s detailed financial data, including year-over-year comparisons, is comprehensive and allows stakeholders to understand the company’s economic performance trends.

2. **Environmental Goals:**
   - Long-term environmental goals tied to a clear baseline (2015) provide a meaningful framework for evaluating future progress, even if detailed interim progress data is limited.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Inclusion of Historical ESG Data:**
   - The report could benefit from more comprehensive historical data on key ESG metrics, such as carbon emissions, water use, waste generation, employee safety, and diversity. This would enable stakeholders to assess trends and track progress more effectively.

2. **Graphical Representation:**
   - Including charts or graphs to visualize performance trends over multiple years would enhance the clarity and accessibility of the comparisons.

3. **Narrative Context:**
   - Providing narrative explanations for performance trends (e.g., reasons for improvements or setbacks) would make comparisons more meaningful and actionable.

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** includes some year-over-year financial comparisons and outlines ambitious long-term environmental goals, but it lacks detailed historical ESG data and trend analysis. To enhance transparency and stakeholder engagement, future reports should provide more comprehensive and visualized comparisons across all ESG dimensions.",1.0,0.0,0.0,0.7272727272727273,0.37,0.7602460659759629

The report indeed provides quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions, specifically detailing Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. Scope 1 emissions refer to direct greenhouse gas emissions produced from sources owned or controlled by the company, while Scope 2 emissions encompass indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the company. Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect emissions that occur in the company's value chain [Data: Entities (782, 822, 1567); Relationships (731, 1782, 1783, 1778)].

### Verification of Emissions Data

To enhance the credibility of its emissions reporting, the company is undertaking Carbon Footprint Verification, which involves measuring and validating the total greenhouse gas emissions produced by the organization. This verification process is crucial as it ensures that the reported emissions data is accurate and reliable [Data: Entities (819); Relationships (730)]. Additionally, the company utilizes third-party independent verification to assess compliance with established standards and regulations, particularly in the context of sustainability reporting [Data: Entities (35); Relationships (447)].

### Conclusion

In summary, the report provides comprehensive and quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions across all three scopes, and these metrics are subject to verification by third-party organizations. This commitment to transparency and accuracy in emissions reporting reflects the company's dedication to sustainability and responsible corporate practices [Data: Entities (0, 50); Relationships (14, 607)].","#### **Carbon Emissions Data and Verification**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** includes details on the company’s carbon emissions, primarily focusing on quantifiable data for **Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions**. However, there is limited mention of **Scope 3 emissions**, and the data provided is supplemented with third-party verification to ensure accuracy and reliability.

---

### **Quantifiable Data on Carbon Emissions**

1. **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions:**
   - The report discloses the company’s efforts to inventory its **Scope 1 (direct emissions)** and **Scope 2 (indirect emissions from energy consumption)**. These emissions are integral to the company’s overarching goal of achieving a **45% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030** and reaching **net-zero emissions by 2050**.
   - The carbon inventory data specifically pertains to the **Kaohsiung plant**, highlighting the company’s targeted approach to managing emissions at a major operational site. However, specific numerical values for annual Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are not included in the accessible portions of the report.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions:**
   - There is no explicit mention or quantification of **Scope 3 emissions**, which include upstream and downstream activities such as supply chain emissions, product use-phase emissions, or end-of-life emissions. This omission limits the report’s comprehensiveness in addressing the full carbon footprint.

---

### **Verification by Third Parties**

1. **Independent Verification:**
   - The report states that the carbon inventory data for the Kaohsiung plant has been **independently verified by SGS**, a globally recognized third-party assurance provider. This verification enhances the credibility and reliability of the emissions data.

2. **Alignment with Standards:**
   - The report aligns with established frameworks such as the **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)** and incorporates principles from the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)**. While these frameworks provide guidance for emissions reporting, the inclusion of verified data aligns with global best practices.

---

### **Strengths in Carbon Emissions Reporting**

1. **Focus on Direct Emissions:**
   - The emphasis on **Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions** demonstrates the company’s commitment to addressing the most immediate sources of its carbon footprint.

2. **Third-party Verification:**
   - The independent verification by **SGS** lends credibility to the carbon inventory data, ensuring stakeholders that the data is accurate and in compliance with international standards.

3. **Clear Reduction Targets:**
   - The company has established clear and measurable reduction goals (e.g., **45% reduction by 2030**), which provide a framework for tracking progress in future reports.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Quantitative Data Transparency:**
   - The report does not provide specific numerical values for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, which limits stakeholders’ ability to assess the company’s baseline and track year-over-year progress.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions Coverage:**
   - The report should include a more detailed analysis of **Scope 3 emissions**, as these often constitute a significant portion of a company’s total carbon footprint. This would align with the growing emphasis on comprehensive value chain emissions reporting.

3. **Detailed Metrics and Trends:**
   - Including historical emissions data and year-over-year trends in a graphical format would improve transparency and allow stakeholders to evaluate progress against stated targets.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** addresses **Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions** with a focus on operational-level data and third-party verification. While the inclusion of verified carbon inventory data enhances the report’s reliability, the lack of numerical values and limited coverage of **Scope 3 emissions** represents an area for improvement. Expanding the scope of emissions reporting and providing detailed metrics would enhance the report’s comprehensiveness and alignment with global best practices in ESG disclosure.",1.0,0.0,0.7442098903416245,0.75,0.34,0.762871569720253

The emission reduction targets set by organizations, particularly in the context of sustainability and climate management, are crucial for addressing climate change. In the data provided, there are specific references to carbon reduction targets and initiatives aimed at decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, Grand Pacific Petrochemical has established a significant goal to reduce carbon emissions by 45% by the year 2030, which indicates a clear commitment to science-based targets [Data: Entities (97); Relationships (948, 261)].

### Science-Based Targets

While the data does not explicitly state that these targets are ""science-based,"" the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 45% aligns with the principles of science-based targets, which are typically derived from climate science to ensure that global temperature rise is limited to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The mention of specific percentage reductions and deadlines suggests that these targets are designed to be measurable and actionable, which is a key characteristic of science-based targets.

### Milestones and Deadlines

The data indicates that the emission reduction targets include specific deadlines, such as the 2030 target for Grand Pacific Petrochemical. However, there is no detailed information on interim milestones or specific tracking mechanisms to monitor progress towards these targets. The focus appears to be on the overarching goal rather than a comprehensive framework of milestones [Data: Entities (97); Relationships (261)].

### Conclusion

In summary, while the emission reduction targets outlined in the data suggest a commitment to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the information does not provide explicit confirmation that these targets are science-based or detail any specific milestones for tracking progress. Further documentation or reports would be necessary to ascertain the full scope of the targets and the mechanisms in place for monitoring their achievement.","#### **Evaluation of Emission Reduction Targets**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** outlines ambitious emission reduction targets, demonstrating the company’s commitment to addressing climate change and aligning with global sustainability goals. However, the evaluation of whether these targets are **science-based** and whether they include **milestones and deadlines** reveals both strengths and areas for improvement.

---

### **Science-based Nature of Targets**

1. **Alignment with International Standards:**
   - The company commits to achieving **net-zero emissions by 2050**, a target aligned with global climate agreements such as the Paris Agreement. Additionally, the report specifies an interim goal to reduce carbon emissions by **45% by 2030**, using **2015 as the baseline year**. This alignment suggests that the company’s targets are broadly consistent with science-based methodologies designed to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

2. **Inclusion of Carbon Reduction Strategies:**
   - Specific strategies, such as transitioning to **renewable energy**, **implementing energy efficiency measures**, and developing a **hydrogen economy**, are highlighted. These strategies are consistent with approaches recommended for achieving science-based targets.

3. **Third-party Verification:**
   - The carbon inventory data for the Kaohsiung plant is verified by **SGS**, lending credibility to the company’s emissions reporting. However, the report does not explicitly state whether the targets have been independently validated as science-based by organizations such as the **Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**.

---

### **Milestones and Deadlines**

1. **Defined Milestones:**
   - The report provides a clear interim milestone of a **45% reduction in emissions by 2030**, offering a tangible benchmark for tracking progress. This intermediate goal is critical for ensuring that the long-term net-zero target is achievable.

2. **Deadlines for Initiatives:**
   - Specific project timelines, such as the **propane dehydrogenation and polypropylene production projects** in Quanzhou (expected to commence in late 2024), indicate actionable steps toward emissions reduction.

3. **Implementation Plans:**
   - The report mentions ongoing **energy transition initiatives**, such as reducing carbon emissions from gas-fired power plants and expanding renewable energy installations. However, it lacks detailed year-by-year breakdowns or specific metrics to assess progress toward the 2030 and 2050 goals.

---

### **Strengths in Emission Reduction Targets**

1. **Ambitious Long-term Vision:**
   - The net-zero emissions goal by 2050 aligns with global sustainability targets, demonstrating a forward-thinking approach.

2. **Interim Milestones:**
   - The 45% reduction target by 2030 provides a measurable and time-bound intermediate objective.

3. **Focus on Innovation:**
   - Investments in **low-carbon products**, **recycled materials**, and a **hydrogen economy** underscore the company’s commitment to sustainable innovation.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Validation as Science-based:**
   - While the targets align with global goals, the report does not explicitly state if they have been validated as **science-based** by an external authority, such as the **SBTi**. Including this validation would enhance the credibility of the targets.

2. **Detailed Progress Metrics:**
   - The report would benefit from more granular data, such as annual emissions reductions achieved to date, to enable stakeholders to track progress effectively.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage of Emissions:**
   - The report focuses on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions but does not include Scope 3 emissions in its reduction targets. A more comprehensive approach would provide a complete picture of the company’s carbon footprint and align with best practices.

---

### **Conclusion**

The emission reduction targets outlined in the **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** demonstrate ambition and alignment with global climate goals. The inclusion of interim milestones, such as the **45% reduction by 2030**, reflects a commitment to measurable progress. However, the absence of explicit validation as **science-based** and limited detail on annual progress metrics present opportunities for improvement. Expanding the targets to include Scope 3 emissions and securing independent validation would enhance the robustness and transparency of the company’s climate strategy.",0.3888888888888889,0.0,0.0,0.7391304347826086,0.4,0.8058645595126337

The company employs a comprehensive framework to assess and disclose the financial and operational risks associated with climate change, particularly focusing on extreme weather events and regulatory changes. This approach is guided by the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which the company integrates into its sustainability reporting. By adhering to TCFD guidelines, the company ensures that its financial disclosures related to climate risks are thorough and transparent, allowing stakeholders to understand the potential impacts on financial performance and governance structures [Data: Relationships (153); Entities (23, 26, 189)].

### Risk Management Strategies

To effectively manage climate-related risks, the company has implemented specific Climate Risk Management Procedures. These procedures are designed to identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks stemming from climate change, including physical risks from extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. The company recognizes floods as a significant risk factor and has developed strategies to address these challenges within its overall risk management framework [Data: Relationships (224, 244); Entities (735, 745)].

### Resilience Analysis and Scenario Planning

The company conducts resilience analyses to assess its capacity to respond to climate-related challenges. This analysis identifies various climate risk scenarios that the organization must prepare for, ensuring that it can adapt to potential future situations regarding climate change impacts. By evaluating these scenarios, the company can develop targeted risk management strategies that address high-risk issues identified in its resilience analysis [Data: Relationships (247, 740); Entities (715, 740)].

### Stakeholder Engagement and Reporting

In addition to internal assessments, the company actively engages with stakeholders to communicate its climate-related risks and management strategies. This engagement includes labor condition inspections and discussions with local communities, customers, and shareholders regarding sustainability and human rights. The company publishes an ESG report that details its sustainability practices and climate risk management efforts, providing stakeholders with valuable insights into its governance and operational strategies [Data: Relationships (688, 640); Entities (66, 169)].

### Conclusion

Overall, the company's approach to assessing and disclosing climate-related financial and operational risks is multifaceted, involving adherence to established frameworks, proactive risk management strategies, and transparent stakeholder communication. This comprehensive strategy not only enhances the company's resilience to climate change but also fosters trust and accountability among its stakeholders [Data: Relationships (396, 640); Entities (66, 169)].","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** outlines the company’s approach to identifying and addressing the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. While it highlights certain climate-related risks and mitigation strategies, the depth of analysis and specific disclosures regarding risk impacts and financial implications are limited. Below is a detailed evaluation of the company’s climate risk assessment and reporting.

---

### **Climate Risk Assessment**

1. **Integration of TCFD Recommendations:**
   - The report indicates that the company aligns its climate-related disclosures with the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** framework. This includes an evaluation of climate risks across governance, strategy, and risk management dimensions, particularly focusing on:
     - **Transition Risks:** Regulatory changes, such as carbon pricing and stricter environmental regulations.
     - **Physical Risks:** Potential impacts of extreme weather events on operational continuity.

2. **Governance Framework:**
   - The **Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO)** and the **ESG Steering Committee** play central roles in overseeing climate-related risks. This governance structure ensures that climate risks are integrated into decision-making processes and operational strategies.

3. **Risk Categories:**
   - The company categorizes climate risks into:
     - **Regulatory Risks:** Potential cost increases due to stricter emissions regulations or carbon taxes.
     - **Operational Risks:** Disruptions caused by extreme weather events, such as floods or typhoons, particularly at production sites.
     - **Market Risks:** Shifts in demand for low-carbon products and potential competition from peers advancing in renewable energy transitions.

---

### **Disclosure of Climate Risks**

1. **Operational Risks:**
   - The report mentions that climate change could exacerbate operational vulnerabilities, especially in energy-intensive production processes. However, there is no detailed analysis of specific facilities or regions at risk of extreme weather events.

2. **Financial Implications:**
   - While the company acknowledges potential financial impacts from regulatory changes (e.g., carbon pricing), it does not quantify these risks or provide scenario analysis to evaluate their potential costs under different climate scenarios.

3. **Transition Strategies:**
   - The company emphasizes its commitment to **reducing carbon emissions by 45% by 2030** and achieving **net-zero emissions by 2050** as part of its strategy to mitigate regulatory and market risks. Initiatives include increasing energy efficiency, investing in renewable energy, and exploring hydrogen as a fuel source.

---

### **Strengths in Climate Risk Management**

1. **Alignment with TCFD:**
   - The alignment with the **TCFD framework** reflects a commitment to adopting globally recognized practices for assessing and disclosing climate risks.

2. **Strategic Governance:**
   - The involvement of the CSO and ESG Steering Committee ensures climate risks are incorporated into governance and operational strategies.

3. **Focus on Decarbonization:**
   - The company’s decarbonization targets and initiatives, such as the adoption of low-carbon technologies and renewable energy, demonstrate proactive measures to mitigate regulatory and market risks.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Quantification of Risks:**
   - The report lacks detailed financial assessments of climate risks. For instance, quantifying the potential costs of carbon pricing or the financial impact of operational disruptions due to extreme weather would provide a clearer understanding of the company’s exposure.

2. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - Including scenario analysis for different climate pathways (e.g., 1.5°C and 2°C scenarios) would enhance the company’s risk disclosure, helping stakeholders evaluate the resilience of its operations and financial performance under varying conditions.

3. **Physical Risk Analysis:**
   - While the report acknowledges physical risks, it does not specify which facilities or regions are most vulnerable. A more detailed risk mapping exercise would improve transparency and aid in prioritizing mitigation efforts.

4. **Enhanced Disclosure on Adaptation Measures:**
   - The report could provide more information on specific adaptation measures being implemented to address physical risks, such as infrastructure improvements or contingency planning.

---

### **Conclusion**

The **GRAND PACIFIC PETROCHEMICAL 2023 ESG Report** demonstrates a foundational understanding of the financial and operational risks posed by climate change, with alignment to the TCFD framework and clear governance structures in place. However, the disclosures could be strengthened by including quantifiable financial impacts, detailed scenario analyses, and more granular assessments of physical risks. Enhancing these aspects would provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the company’s resilience to climate-related risks and its readiness to navigate a low-carbon future.",1.0,0.0,0.9019867582077732,0.9230769230769232,0.34,0.794682219111979

The report does not explicitly detail the diversity of the Board of Directors or the specific ESG-related expertise of its members. However, it does highlight the Board's critical role in overseeing the governance performance and strategic direction of the organization, particularly concerning climate management and sustainability efforts. The Board is responsible for formulating risk management policies and strategies based on insights from Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports and presentations from the ESG Steering Committee [Data: Relationships (661, 119); Entities (144, 50)].

### Governance and ESG Oversight

The Board of Directors at Grand Pacific Petrochemical is tasked with ensuring compliance with laws and ethical standards while managing the company's operations. It plays a significant role in evaluating the performance of directors and managerial officers, overseeing the Remuneration Committee, and preparing the annual net income report for shareholder resolution [Data: Relationships (144, 1219); Entities (50, 144)]. 

Moreover, the Board supervises the ESG Steering Committee, which is responsible for guiding the implementation of ESG policies and strategies across the organization. This committee evaluates climate risk and opportunity factors pertinent to the company, ensuring that stakeholder concerns are addressed and that there is inclusiveness in organizational operations [Data: Relationships (1155, 1158); Entities (132)].

### Conclusion

While the report emphasizes the Board's governance responsibilities and its relationship with the ESG Steering Committee, it lacks specific information regarding the diversity of its members and their individual expertise in ESG matters. This absence of detail may limit stakeholders' understanding of how diversity and specialized knowledge in ESG contribute to the Board's decision-making processes. Further disclosures in future reports could enhance transparency and stakeholder engagement regarding these critical aspects of governance.","#### **Board Structure and ESG Oversight**
