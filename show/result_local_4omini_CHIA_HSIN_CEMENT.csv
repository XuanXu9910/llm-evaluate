The company's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives are intricately woven into its overall business strategy, reflecting a commitment to sustainable practices that align with its operational goals. The integration of ESG principles is evident in various aspects of the company's operations, including its focus on corporate governance, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.

### Clear Articulation of ESG Connections

The company has established a **Sustainable Development Blueprint**, which outlines its future ESG plans and commitments. This blueprint serves as a guiding framework for the organization, detailing strategies for responsible investment and environmental protection [Data: Entities (83); Relationships (734, 733)]. The **Annual Report** further emphasizes the connection between ESG initiatives and business strategy by including sections that highlight the company's sustainable development goals and performance metrics [Data: Entities (368); Relationships (734)].

Moreover, the company actively addresses **Material Issues** that significantly impact its operations and stakeholder interests. These issues are identified through stakeholder feedback and are reviewed every three years to ensure they remain relevant [Data: Entities (395); Relationships (932)]. This systematic approach not only aligns the company's ESG efforts with its business strategy but also ensures that these initiatives are actionable and responsive to stakeholder concerns.

### Actionable Connections

The company's commitment to integrating ESG principles is actionable, as evidenced by its various initiatives aimed at enhancing operational effectiveness and stakeholder satisfaction. For instance, the **Sustainable Development Committee** is tasked with implementing sustainability initiatives and overseeing the progress of these efforts [Data: Entities (640); Relationships (614)]. This committee plays a crucial role in ensuring that ESG strategies are not only articulated but also executed effectively.

Additionally, the company has implemented a **Code of Integrity Management** and conducts training programs to promote ethical practices among employees and suppliers [Data: Entities (963, 971); Relationships (206)]. These initiatives demonstrate a clear link between the company's ethical commitments and its overall business strategy, fostering a culture of integrity that supports long-term sustainability.

### Conclusion

The current sustainability report does not explicitly mention a comparison of current ESG performance data with historical data to highlight progress or trends over time. However, it does emphasize the importance of evaluating the Company's 2023 performance, which encompasses a comprehensive assessment of its operations, management methods, environmental impact, sustainability efforts, and financial results during the year 2023 [Data: Relationships (949, 417, 1638)]. This evaluation aims to provide insights into the Company's overall performance, including achievements and areas for improvement.

### Transparency in Reporting

Transparency is a key principle guiding the Chia Hsin Cement Group's sustainability reporting, ensuring stakeholders have clear insights into their operations [Data: Entities (531); Relationships (376)]. The report is structured to align with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, which are designed to promote accountability and transparency in sustainability practices [Data: Entities (522); Relationships (34)]. This alignment suggests that while historical comparisons may not be explicitly detailed, the framework used for reporting is intended to provide a clear and accountable overview of the Company's sustainability efforts.

### Conclusion

In summary, while the current report does not explicitly compare current ESG performance data with historical data, it focuses on a comprehensive evaluation of the 2023 performance. The commitment to transparency and adherence to GRI standards indicates that the Company aims to provide meaningful insights into its sustainability practices, although the effectiveness of these comparisons in highlighting trends over time may require further elaboration in future reports.","#### **Comparison of ESG Performance Data with Historical Data**

The ESG report of **Chia Hsin Cement Corporation** includes meaningful comparisons of current ESG performance with historical data, effectively highlighting progress and trends over time. These comparisons are detailed and transparent, covering key metrics across environmental, social, and governance dimensions.

---

### **Environmental Performance**

1. **Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions:**
   - The report provides a year-over-year comparison of **Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions**, demonstrating a slight increase of **345.67 tCO2e** in 2023 compared to 2022. Despite this increase, the **carbon intensity** (measured as emissions per unit of revenue) decreased from **3.39 to 2.74 tons per 100 million dollars**, reflecting improved efficiency and decarbonization efforts.

2. **Carbon Reduction Targets:**
   - The company has conducted a full carbon inventory across all domestic and international sites for the second consecutive year. It compares the baseline year of **2022** with the current year to track progress toward its **42% reduction target for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030** under the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

3. **Energy Efficiency:**
   - The report highlights improvements in energy efficiency at operational sites, including the certification of **five additional locations under ISO 50001 in 2023**, bringing the total to six certified sites. Historical data comparisons emphasize the company’s efforts to enhance energy management.

---

### **Social Performance**

1. **Employee Satisfaction and Welfare:**
   - The report tracks progress in employee engagement through initiatives such as flexible working policies, employee assistance programs, and expanded health benefits. It cites survey results and new programs introduced in 2023, but detailed year-over-year metrics, such as changes in satisfaction rates, are not explicitly compared.

2. **Talent Development:**
   - Historical data is used to showcase the evolution of training programs. For example, the company introduced competency models and departmental succession plans in 2023, building on prior training frameworks. However, quantitative comparisons of participation or outcomes are limited.

---

### **Governance Performance**

1. **Corporate Governance Ratings:**
   - Chia Hsin Cement Corporation has consistently ranked in the **top 6-20% of listed companies** in the Corporate Governance Evaluation for four consecutive years. This comparison underscores the company's ongoing commitment to maintaining high governance standards.

2. **Risk Management:**
   - The report discusses enhancements to risk management policies and their implementation. For example, the **2023 Risk Assessment Report** builds on prior years’ efforts to integrate ESG risks into the company’s overall governance framework, demonstrating continuous improvement.

---

### **Strengths in Historical Comparisons**

1. **Transparency:**
   - The report provides clear year-over-year comparisons in key areas such as carbon emissions, energy efficiency, and governance ratings. These comparisons are supported by data verified through third-party assurance, ensuring credibility.

2. **Actionable Insights:**
   - The historical comparisons are tied to actionable initiatives, such as the installation of solar photovoltaic systems to meet energy and emissions targets, showing a direct link between past performance and future strategies.

3. **Comprehensive Environmental Metrics:**
   - The focus on carbon intensity and efficiency improvements offers a meaningful way to measure progress, even when absolute emissions increase due to external factors such as post-pandemic recovery.

---

### **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Social Metrics:**
   - While the report includes qualitative updates on social initiatives, quantitative year-over-year comparisons, such as changes in employee satisfaction or training participation, are limited. Enhanced transparency in this area would provide a clearer picture of progress.

2. **Broader Historical Context:**
   - Historical data for some metrics, such as water usage, waste management, or Scope 3 emissions, is not consistently provided. Expanding comparisons to include these areas would offer a more holistic view of the company’s environmental and operational performance over time.

---

In summary, the ESG report provides meaningful and transparent historical comparisons in key areas, particularly environmental performance and governance. However, the inclusion of more comprehensive year-over-year data, especially for social and broader environmental metrics, would strengthen the report’s ability to demonstrate progress and trends effectively. This approach would further reinforce Chia Hsin Cement Corporation’s commitment to accountability and continuous improvement.",1.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.25,0.8677562502619718

Reporting

The report does provide quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions, specifically detailing Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions. These categories represent different sources of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the company's operations:

- **Scope 1 Emissions** refer to direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the company, such as vehicle usage and natural gas consumption. The Chia Hsin Cement Group has set a target to reduce its Scope 1 emissions by 42% by 2030 [Data: Relationships (289)].

- **Scope 2 Emissions** are indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the organization. The company aims to reduce its Scope 2 emissions as part of its climate goals [Data: Relationships (290)].

- **Scope 3 Emissions** encompass all other indirect emissions that occur within the company's value chain, including both upstream and downstream activities. The Chia Hsin Cement Group is actively engaged in measuring and implementing strategies to reduce these emissions [Data: Relationships (291)].

## Verification of Emissions Data

The metrics related to carbon emissions are indeed verified by third parties. The Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which includes comprehensive accounting of all greenhouse gas emissions and removals, has been verified by third parties to ensure accuracy and reliability [Data: Entities (90)]. This verification process is crucial for maintaining transparency and accountability in the company's sustainability efforts.

In summary, the report provides detailed and quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions across all three scopes, and these metrics are supported by third-party verification to enhance their credibility and reliability.","#### **Quantifiable Data on Carbon Emissions**
