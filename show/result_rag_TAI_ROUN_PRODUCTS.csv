The report encompasses data from January 1 to December 31, 2023, and adheres to the principles outlined in the GRI framework, which is recognized internationally for sustainability reporting. The GRI standards provide guidelines for organizations to report on their economic, environmental, and social impacts, thereby promoting transparency and accountability.

In terms of alignment, the report includes detailed disclosures across various indicators that reflect the key aspects of the GRI framework. For instance, it covers organizational details, governance structure, stakeholder engagement, and material issues related to sustainability. The report's chapters correspond with specific GRI disclosure indicators, indicating a comprehensive approach to sustainability management. Key topics such as product safety, employee welfare, energy conservation, and corporate governance are addressed, demonstrating a commitment to the transparency and thoroughness expected under GRI standards.

However, the report does not reference other frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) or the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which are also recognized globally. This focus on GRI suggests that while the report is well-aligned with this particular framework, there may be opportunities for improvement in integrating additional frameworks like SASB or TCFD for a more holistic view of sustainability and climate-related disclosures. Overall, Tairoun Products' report appears to be robust in its adherence to GRI standards but could enhance its comprehensiveness by incorporating other internationally recognized frameworks.","### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The ESG report of Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. adheres to internationally recognized frameworks to ensure the credibility and comprehensiveness of its sustainability disclosures. Specifically, the report follows:

1. **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards**:
   - The report is drafted in accordance with the GRI Standards issued by the Global Reporting Initiative, as highlighted in the editorial principles section. It adopts a core disclosure approach, focusing on material topics relevant to stakeholders and aligned with global sustainability practices.

2. **Third-Party Assurance**:
   - To enhance reliability, the report undergoes independent limited assurance by BDO Taiwan Union & Co. This assurance aligns with GAAP 3000 (""Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information""), which underscores its compliance with international assurance standards.

3. **ISO Standards**:
   - The company integrates ISO standards into its operations, including ISO 22000 for food safety management and ISO 9001 for quality management. These certifications reflect a commitment to internationally accepted operational and reporting practices.

---

### **Alignment with Frameworks**

#### **Strengths**:

1. **Robust Data Collection and Disclosure**:
   - Tairoun follows structured data collection and measurement methods aligned with GRI Standards, ensuring compliance with local regulations or, where applicable, international and industry-specific standards.

2. **Third-Party Verification**:
   - The engagement of an independent assurance provider reinforces the credibility of the report. By adhering to GAAP 3000, the company demonstrates its commitment to transparency and accountability.

3. **Integration of ISO Standards**:
   - The adoption of ISO standards, particularly in food safety and quality management, reflects a strong alignment with best practices in operational and sustainability management.

4. **Transparency in Material Issues**:
   - The report incorporates stakeholder concerns into its materiality assessment, guided by GRI’s material topics framework. This ensures a balanced approach to addressing economic, environmental, and social impacts.

---

#### **Areas for Improvement**:

1. **Broader Framework Integration**:
   - While the report adheres to GRI Standards and ISO certifications, it does not explicitly reference frameworks such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) or the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Including these could enhance the report's relevance to global investors and climate-related risk disclosures.

2. **Clearer SDG Alignment**:
   - Although the company outlines its sustainable development strategies, a detailed mapping of contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would provide greater clarity and alignment with global sustainability agendas.

3. **Enhanced Assurance Scope**:
   - While third-party assurance is provided, extending its scope to cover more non-financial indicators would further enhance stakeholder confidence in the disclosed data.

---

### **Conclusion**

Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. demonstrates a strong commitment to sustainability reporting by adhering to GRI Standards, leveraging third-party assurance, and aligning its operational processes with ISO standards. However, the report could benefit from integrating additional internationally recognized frameworks like SASB and TCFD and providing detailed SDG mapping to enhance its global relevance and comprehensiveness.",0.1578947368421052,0.0909090908264462,0.6400213853121106,0.5757575757575758,0.5,0.8312808620685659

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** provides a clear and structured definition of its organizational scope and time frame. This information is crucial for ensuring transparency and allowing stakeholders to understand the boundaries of the disclosed data. Below are the details:

---

#### **Time Frame**

The report covers the period from **January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023**, which aligns with the company’s fiscal year. It also includes a brief explanation regarding differences in reporting periods for statistical data, ensuring clarity where variations might exist. Additionally, the publication and future issuance timeline are noted:
- **Date of Initial Issuance**: September 2015.
- **Date of Current Issuance**: August 2024.
- **Date of Next Issuance**: August 2025.

This precise timeline establishes the continuity and periodicity of the company’s ESG disclosures.

---

#### **Organizational Scope**

The report clearly identifies the organizational boundaries, focusing primarily on the parent company, **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.**, and its operations in Taiwan. Specific coverage includes:
1. **Main Operational Sites**:
   - **Yunlin Plant**: Specializes in producing corn starch and high fructose syrup.
   - **Kaohsiung Plant**: Produces various feed products.

2. **Subsidiaries and Affiliates**:
   - The report briefly mentions that **Horoun Products Co., Ltd.** is included in consolidated financial statements. However, due to its minimal revenue contribution, its impact on the report’s scope is noted as insignificant.

3. **Exclusions**:
   - Joint ventures, subsidiaries, or leased facilities that do not significantly impact operations are excluded. This delineation is explicitly stated, reinforcing the focus on core operational entities.

4. **Supply Chain and External Boundaries**:
   - While the report emphasizes Tairoun’s direct operations, it mentions interactions with external supply chains, such as procurement of raw materials (e.g., corn, cassava starch), which undergo rigorous quality assurance checks but are not directly included in the operational scope.

---

#### **Clarity and Comprehensiveness**

The report provides a structured explanation of its boundaries, ensuring stakeholders can discern the limits of the data disclosed. It effectively outlines the areas covered by the sustainability initiatives and operations, maintaining consistency with prior reports by explicitly stating there were no significant changes in organizational scale or ownership during the reporting period.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

#### **Strengths**:
1. **Precise Time Frame**:
   - Clearly defined reporting period ensures consistency and comparability across reporting cycles.
   
2. **Transparent Organizational Boundaries**:
   - The focus on core operations in Taiwan and a clear exclusion of immaterial entities ensure relevance.

3. **Continuity of Scope**:
   - The report explicitly mentions no significant changes in scale, ownership, or impact compared to previous years.

#### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Broader Supply Chain Inclusion**:
   - Although the report mentions raw material procurement, further detail on sustainability practices within the supply chain would enhance transparency.

2. **Explicit Subsidiary Reporting**:
   - While Horoun Products Co., Ltd. is mentioned, more detail about its sustainability impact or initiatives could provide a holistic view.

---

It emphasizes a systematic approach to sustainability management, highlighting the alignment of ESG goals with long-term corporate strategies. The report notes that the company conducts regular reviews of both internal and external sustainability statuses, which promotes continuous improvement across all departments. This alignment is aimed at creating shared value for both society and the company, implying that ESG initiatives are not merely compliance-driven but are woven into the fabric of the company’s operational ethos.

To ensure these ESG initiatives are actionable, the report identifies material issues that are of significance to various stakeholders, including investors, clients, employees, government agencies, and suppliers. By categorizing and prioritizing these issues based on their impact on the company and the level of stakeholder concern, the report provides a clear framework for addressing these priorities. For instance, the company emphasizes the importance of product safety, employee welfare, and environmental protection as key components of its strategy, demonstrating a commitment to not only meeting regulatory requirements but also resonating with stakeholder expectations.

Moreover, the report describes specific governance structures that oversee ESG performance, such as the role of the highest governance body in sustainability reporting and the management of material topics. These governance mechanisms ensure that ESG initiatives are tracked, evaluated, and reported, which further solidifies their connection to the company's business strategy. The inclusion of performance indicators and the commitment to transparent information disclosure also indicate that these connections are not only clearly articulated but are underpinned by measurable objectives that guide the company’s actions in the realm of sustainability.

In summary, the report effectively links the company's ESG initiatives to its overall business strategy through a structured approach that prioritizes stakeholder engagement, identifies material issues, and establishes clear governance and performance tracking mechanisms. This comprehensive framework suggests that the connections made are both actionable and integral to the company's long-term success.","### **Linkage Between ESG Initiatives and Business Strategy**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** effectively establishes a connection between its sustainability initiatives and its overall business strategy. This linkage is articulated through structured sections in the report that align ESG priorities with core business objectives, operational processes, and long-term goals. Below is an evaluation of these connections based on the report:

---

#### **Integration of ESG Initiatives into Business Strategy**

1. **Sustainability Embedded in Business Operations**:
   - Tairoun’s commitment to sustainability is evident in its strategic focus on energy conservation, carbon reduction, and product innovation. For instance, the company’s **transition to natural gas boilers and biomass fuel steam procurement** at the Yunlin Plant directly supports its environmental goals while ensuring operational efficiency. These actions reflect a dual focus on sustainability and cost management, a clear integration of ESG efforts into core business strategies.

2. **Sustainable Product Development**:
   - The company aligns its product innovation with sustainability by investing in the development of **deep-processed corn products** and optimizing production to reduce costs and environmental impact. This supports the business’s long-term growth strategy by improving competitiveness in the food and feed markets.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement and Governance**:
   - Corporate governance principles such as ethical management and stakeholder communication are explicitly linked to the company’s operational strategy. For example, **risk management frameworks** and **stakeholder dialogue mechanisms** ensure that the company addresses risks while maintaining transparency, aligning ESG priorities with business resilience and accountability.

---

#### **Strategic Focus on Material ESG Topics**

1. **Energy and Resource Efficiency**:
   - The company’s **energy conservation measures**, including the installation of solar photovoltaic systems and equipment upgrades, demonstrate a strategic approach to reducing operational costs while contributing to national and global sustainability goals. This connection between resource efficiency and financial performance highlights how ESG initiatives are actionable within the business model.

2. **Supply Chain Sustainability**:
   - Tairoun emphasizes ethical supplier selection and audits to ensure labor rights compliance and environmental standards. This approach ensures that upstream supply chain activities align with the company’s ESG principles, reducing risks and improving long-term supplier relationships.

3. **Community Engagement**:
   - Through initiatives such as supporting local events and providing resources for community festivals, the company strengthens its reputation and builds goodwill in operational regions. These social welfare programs complement the company’s strategy of fostering harmonious relationships with neighboring communities.

---

#### **Actionability of ESG Connections**

1. **Clear Roadmaps and Metrics**:
   - The report outlines short-, mid-, and long-term sustainability plans, including actionable targets such as achieving **net zero emissions by 2050**. These plans are complemented by measurable indicators, such as greenhouse gas inventory reporting and renewable energy adoption, ensuring accountability and progress tracking.

2. **Alignment with Corporate Philosophy**:
   - The sustainability strategy is embedded in the company’s operational philosophy of creating shared value. Initiatives such as adopting **FSSC22000** and **HACCP certifications** for food safety management show how ESG goals directly contribute to maintaining product quality and customer trust.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

#### **Strengths**:
1. **Strong Operational Integration**:
   - ESG goals are closely tied to operational strategies, particularly in energy, product safety, and community engagement.

2. **Detailed Planning and Reporting**:
   - The use of structured plans with timelines and performance metrics ensures that sustainability initiatives are actionable.

3. **Stakeholder-Centric Approach**:
   - The inclusion of stakeholder feedback in identifying material issues strengthens the alignment between business strategy and ESG initiatives.

#### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Broader Value Chain Integration**:
   - While the report discusses supply chain sustainability, further emphasis on downstream impacts (e.g., customer usage and end-of-life product management) could enhance the holistic integration of ESG principles.

2. **Explicit Financial Linkages**:
   - The report could benefit from more explicit connections between ESG initiatives and financial performance, such as cost savings from energy efficiency or revenue growth from sustainable products.

For example, the report provides comparative data on gross operating profit, net income, and earnings per share over the past three years. This allows stakeholders to observe trends and assess the company's financial progress in relation to its sustainability efforts.

Moreover, the report outlines energy sustainability and environmental management by presenting a historical comparison of fuel oil usage, emissions, and total emissions equivalents over five years. Such data allows for an analysis of how the company's environmental impact has evolved, demonstrating whether improvements or increases have occurred in emissions or energy consumption.

In terms of transparency, the report adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, which enhances its credibility. It includes detailed disclosures regarding the methodologies for data collection and the criteria used for evaluation, which are crucial for stakeholders to understand the context of the figures presented. The systematic approach to reporting—such as the identification of material issues, stakeholder engagement, and compliance with legal standards—further supports the meaningfulness of the comparisons made.

Overall, the historical comparisons in the report are not only present but are also framed in a way that allows readers to gauge the company's commitment to sustainability over time. However, the effectiveness of these comparisons in conveying progress may depend on clear contextual explanations and the specific metrics chosen for comparison.","### **Comparison of Current and Historical ESG Performance Data**

- **Scope 2 Emissions** (indirect GHG emissions from energy consumption):
  - 2021: 15,561 tCO2e
  - 2022: 14,616 tCO2e
  - 2023: 13,601 tCO2e

The report notes that the GHG emission intensity encompasses both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. However, it does not provide any specific data or metrics related to Scope 3 emissions, which cover other indirect emissions not included in Scope 2.

Regarding verification by third parties, the report includes a summary table of assurance items and mentions a CPA's limited assurance report, indicating that there may be some level of third-party verification. However, further details on the scope of this verification or whether it encompasses the carbon emissions data specifically are not explicitly outlined in the provided excerpts. Therefore, while there is a mention of external assurance, the extent and specifics of third-party verification for the emissions metrics presented remain unclear.","### **Carbon Emissions Reporting**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** outlines the company’s commitment to environmental sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) management. However, while the report emphasizes energy conservation and emissions reduction measures, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of **Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions**. Below is a comprehensive evaluation based on the available data:

---

#### **Quantifiable Data on Carbon Emissions**

   - The report mentions the implementation of specific energy conservation measures, such as transitioning to **natural gas boilers** and utilizing **solar photovoltaic systems** at the Yunlin Plant, as part of its efforts to reduce direct and indirect emissions. However, no explicit quantifiable data is provided for Scope 1 (direct emissions) or Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased energy) in terms of metric tons of CO₂ equivalent.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions**:
   - There is no mention of Scope 3 emissions, which include indirect emissions across the value chain (e.g., raw material production, transportation, and end-of-life product handling).

3. **GHG Inventory and Reporting**:
   - The report states that Tairoun prepares annual **GHG inventory reports**, focusing on energy consumption and pollutant emissions. However, these inventories are not included in the report, and no specific numerical values or trends are disclosed.

---

#### **Verification of Metrics**

- The report highlights that its data collection and reporting methodologies comply with **local regulations** or, where not specified, international standards. However, while **BDO Taiwan Union & Co.** conducted limited third-party assurance for the report, it is unclear whether this assurance explicitly covered carbon emissions metrics.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

#### **Strengths**:
1. **Commitment to GHG Management**:
   - Actions such as adopting natural gas boilers and installing renewable energy systems demonstrate a proactive approach to emissions reduction.

2. **Integration with Sustainability Goals**:
   - The report aligns its energy conservation and emissions reduction efforts with broader goals, such as achieving **net zero emissions by 2050**.

#### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Lack of Quantifiable Emissions Data**:
   - The absence of specific numerical data for Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions limits the report’s ability to provide a comprehensive view of its carbon footprint.

2. **Third-Party Verification Scope**:
   - While the report is assured by an external party, explicit confirmation of emissions verification would enhance credibility.

3. **Expanded Scope 3 Reporting**:
   - Including emissions from upstream and downstream activities would provide a more holistic assessment of the company’s environmental impact.

---

### **Conclusion**

The ESG report of Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. demonstrates a commitment to emissions reduction through specific initiatives and GHG inventory preparation. However, the lack of detailed, quantifiable data on Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions, coupled with limited clarity on third-party verification of these metrics, represents a significant gap. To strengthen future reports, the company should disclose comprehensive emissions data, provide verification details, and expand the scope of its carbon footprint assessment to include Scope 3 emissions.",1.0,0.3571428568877551,0.0,0.75,0.27,0.6770524060753473
Are the emission reduction targets outlined in the report science-based? Do they include milestones and deadlines to track progress effectively?,[],"I don't have access to the specific report you're referring to, so I cannot directly evaluate whether the emission reduction targets are science-based or if they include milestones and deadlines for tracking progress. Generally, science-based targets are those that align with the latest climate science, typically aiming to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement.

To determine if the targets are science-based, you would typically look for alignment with methodologies developed by organizations like the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which provides frameworks for companies to set emissions reduction targets in line with climate science. Additionally, a robust target should include specific milestones and deadlines to ensure accountability and track progress, often laid out in a clear timeline.

If you have access to the specifics of the report, I recommend reviewing the target-setting methodology and any accompanying timelines or milestones to assess their credibility and effectiveness in tracking progress.","### **Assessment of Emission Reduction Targets**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** outlines the company’s commitment to reducing emissions and achieving sustainability goals. However, the emission reduction targets described are not explicitly labeled as **science-based targets (SBTs)**, and while some milestones and deadlines are included, they lack comprehensive specificity. Below is a detailed evaluation:

---

#### **Emission Reduction Targets and Their Basis**

1. **Net Zero Emissions Goal**:
   - The report highlights Tairoun’s aim to achieve **net zero emissions by 2050**, aligning with global sustainability initiatives and Taiwan’s green energy development goals. This target reflects a long-term vision but does not explicitly refer to adherence to frameworks such as the **Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)**, which ensures alignment with climate science.

2. **Renewable Energy Integration**:
   - Key initiatives, such as the installation of **solar photovoltaic systems** at the Yunlin Plant and the transition to natural gas boilers, are indicative of efforts to reduce direct emissions. However, these efforts are described in general terms without specifying how they contribute quantitatively to the net zero target.

3. **GHG Inventory Reporting**:
   - The company prepares annual **GHG inventory reports**, focusing on energy consumption and pollutant emissions. While this demonstrates awareness and monitoring, the absence of explicit Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emission reduction benchmarks limits the clarity of progress tracking.

---

#### **Milestones and Deadlines**

1. **Long-Term Deadline (2050)**:
   - The commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 provides a clear endpoint, aligning with global sustainability timelines. However, interim milestones that detail incremental reductions are not included in the report, making it challenging to assess progress.

2. **Operational Milestones**:
   - Some operational changes, such as the annual replacement of older equipment since 2016 and renewable energy installations, are described but lack accompanying quantitative milestones or deadlines for specific emission reductions.

#### **Strengths**:
1. **Commitment to Water Conservation**:
   - The report demonstrates awareness of water resource challenges and includes water conservation as a key element of its sustainability strategy.

2. **Integration with Broader Goals**:
   - Water management is contextualized within the company’s larger climate change adaptation and efficiency improvement initiatives.

#### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Quantitative Data**:
   - The report does not include specific metrics on water usage, such as total consumption, recycling rates, or water intensity. Including such data would provide stakeholders with a clearer understanding of the company’s performance and progress.

2. **Impact of Initiatives**:
   - While the report mentions measures to reduce water consumption, it lacks details on the outcomes or impact of these initiatives. Quantifying savings or efficiency improvements would enhance transparency.

3. **Comparison with Previous Years**:
   - Historical data on water usage and conservation efforts would allow for trend analysis and evaluation of long-term performance.

---

### **Conclusion**

The ESG report of Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. outlines a commitment to water resource management, focusing on conservation, recycling, and aligning with broader climate adaptation strategies. However, the lack of detailed, quantitative data on water usage, recycling rates, and the measurable impact of conservation initiatives limits the comprehensiveness of the disclosure. Including specific metrics, year-over-year comparisons, and quantified outcomes of water management practices in future reports would significantly enhance transparency and stakeholder confidence in the company’s efforts to address water sustainability challenges.",1.0,0.2222222219753086,0.7423535264067946,1.0,0.53,0.6891200947514388

### **Conclusion**

Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. demonstrates an understanding of climate-related risks and outlines proactive measures to mitigate their operational impacts. However, the report lacks a structured framework for assessing and disclosing the financial implications of these risks. By adopting a recognized standard, such as TCFD, and providing quantitative analyses of risk scenarios and financial impacts, the company can significantly enhance the transparency and comprehensiveness of its climate risk disclosures. This would enable stakeholders to better evaluate its resilience and preparedness in the face of climate change challenges.",1.0,0.0909090908264462,0.9390973232703153,0.9230769230769232,0.46,0.6943103402477612

These measures include a commitment to non-discrimination in salary and benefits based on race, religion, or political stance, and a comprehensive plan designed to prevent workplace misconduct. Specific initiatives include gender equality education and training, policies against workplace bullying, maternity protection plans, and mandatory statements from new employees refusing sexual harassment. Such initiatives are designed to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that provides equitable opportunities for all employees.

In terms of representation, the company's practices reflect its commitment to diversity. For instance, at its major operational sites, including the Yunlin Plant and Kaohsiung Feed Plant, 98% of management positions at the section head level and above are filled by local residents. This indicates a strong emphasis on local talent employment. Furthermore, the company actively employs individuals with disabilities and collaborates with supportive workshops to ensure appropriate job placements based on individual capabilities.

For example, the report includes data on the percentage of local employment in management positions and details about the employment of persons with disabilities. Although the report does not provide detailed numerical data on gender or minority representation in the workforce, it emphasizes a commitment to diverse talent recruitment and retention, alongside programs for upgrading employee skills and career development opportunities. Overall, these policies and initiatives reflect the company's dedication to creating an equitable work environment that values diversity.","### **Employee Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Policies**

It emphasizes the company's commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy working environment through various structured programs and metrics.

One of the key metrics provided in the report is the absenteeism rate, which reflects the percentage of work hours lost due to employee absences. For male employees, the absenteeism rate is 12.34%, while for female employees, it stands at 10.77%, leading to an overall absenteeism rate of 11.85%. This metric is calculated based on total absence hours divided by total working hours, multiplied by 100%. Additionally, the report notes that the company has not recorded any occupational diseases or work-related injuries, leading to an occupational disease rate and a rate of leave due to work-related injuries of 0%. This absence of reported injuries indicates effective safety measures in place.

The report also discusses the establishment of an Occupational Safety and Health Management System, which is being implemented as per legal requirements due to the workforce size exceeding 200 employees. The management department has dedicated resources to ensure the system's completion by 2024. Regular health checkups and training programs for employees, including first aid and emergency response training, are also part of the safety initiatives. The report highlights that employees are educated on workplace safety and emergency procedures, bolstered by the installation of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in the workplace.

In summary, the report effectively addresses employee health and safety through a combination of metrics, such as absenteeism and injury rates, as well as outlining comprehensive training and management systems aimed at improving workplace safety.

Central to these efforts is the commitment to uphold labor rights by strictly prohibiting any form of discrimination, including gender discrimination, and ensuring that employees are not treated differently based on their race, religion, or political stance. The company has implemented various policies to prevent workplace misconduct, including training on gender equality, workplace bullying prevention, and mandatory agreements against sexual harassment for new hires. These initiatives are designed to foster a diverse and inclusive workplace culture that provides equal opportunities for all employees.

In terms of compliance and oversight, the report details a structured approach to monitoring human rights practices. For instance, the company assesses its suppliers based on their adherence to labor rights through a supplier evaluation system that includes both on-site audits and document reviews. This evaluation process ensures that suppliers comply with established labor standards and maintain ethical practices. The report also highlights the importance of continuous improvement in supplier management by requiring suppliers to conduct self-evaluations and confirm compliance with the company's Supplier Code of Conduct.

Additionally, the company conducts regular training on human rights policies for its employees, particularly for those in supervisory positions. This training is aimed at enhancing their understanding of human rights protection and ensuring that any violations are promptly addressed. The report states that no incidents of discrimination or related cases have occurred, indicating a proactive stance in maintaining fair labor practices.

Moreover, the company has established grievance channels, allowing employees to report any concerns or violations they may encounter. These channels are crucial for fostering transparency and accountability within the organizational culture and ensuring that all employees feel safe and supported in raising issues related to their rights. The implementation of these measures reflects a comprehensive strategy to safeguard human rights and promote fair labor practices throughout the company's operations and supply chain.","### **Safeguarding Human Rights Across Operations and Supply Chain**

Instead, the responsibility for tracking performance related to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) issues is distributed among various departments within their respective areas of authority. These departmental evaluations are coordinated by the Management Department, which serves as the central hub for communication and management related to sustainability initiatives. 

The governance structure incorporates sustainability into its operations by having relevant issues reported to the General Manager through project meetings. During these meetings, if specific issues are deemed significant for disclosure, they are included in the sustainability report as per the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. This process highlights a collaborative approach where the General Manager and heads of units participate in decision-making, ensuring that sustainability matters are addressed at a high level within the company’s governance framework.

Moreover, the company follows a structured material issues identification process that involves stakeholders and analyzes various concerns based on their impact and relevance. This evaluation helps prioritize significant issues and aligns them with the company's long-term sustainability goals. Overall, while a specific ESG committee is absent, the integration of sustainability responsibilities within existing governance structures reflects a commitment to addressing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors through coordinated departmental efforts and executive oversight.","### **ESG Governance and Leadership**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** provides details on the company’s governance structure and the integration of sustainability efforts into its operational framework. Below is an analysis of the extent to which the company demonstrates leadership and accountability in managing ESG initiatives.

---

#### **Governance Structure for ESG Oversight**

1. **Board of Directors**:
   - Tairoun’s governance framework is anchored by a Board of Directors comprising 13 members, including three independent directors. In 2023, the Board convened six times with a director attendance rate of 97%, indicating active involvement in oversight responsibilities.

2. **Delegation of Responsibility**:
   - While Tairoun has not established a dedicated ESG or Corporate Sustainability Committee, sustainability management is decentralized across departments. The Management Department acts as the coordinating body, consolidating evaluations and implementations from respective operational units. Relevant issues are reported to the General Manager during project meetings and subsequently disclosed in the sustainability report in alignment with GRI Standards.

3. **Functional Committees**:
   - The company has established specialized committees such as the Audit and Remuneration Committees to manage aspects like financial reporting, internal controls, and performance evaluation of senior executives. However, ESG-specific responsibilities are not explicitly assigned to these committees.

---

#### **Integration of Sustainability into Governance**

1. **Materiality Analysis**:
   - The company has adopted a structured process to identify material issues that impact stakeholders and its operations. This analysis encompasses environmental, social, and governance dimensions and informs the strategic alignment of sustainability efforts with long-term goals.

2. **Operational Oversight**:
   - Sustainability initiatives are monitored at the departmental level, ensuring accountability. Departments such as the Management Department play a pivotal role in legal compliance, labor safety, and health initiatives, among other responsibilities.

3. **Ethical Corporate Management**:
   - Tairoun’s governance includes a ""Code of Ethical Conduct"" and ""Ethical Corporate Management Best Practice Principles"" approved by the Board. These policies aim to enhance corporate transparency, promote ethical behavior, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

##### **Strengths**:
1. **Well-Defined Governance Framework**:
   - The presence of independent directors and functional committees enhances oversight and aligns governance practices with regulatory expectations.
   
2. **Transparency in Reporting**:
   - The integration of material issues into the sustainability report and disclosure of Board activities demonstrate transparency and accountability.

##### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Dedicated ESG Committee**:
   - Establishing a dedicated ESG or Sustainability Committee at the executive level would centralize oversight and ensure consistent management of ESG priorities.

2. **Explicit Role Assignments**:
   - While sustainability efforts are decentralized, defining explicit responsibilities for ESG governance within the Board or committees could enhance strategic focus and decision-making.

---

### **Conclusion**

Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. has made significant strides in integrating sustainability into its governance structure. The company’s approach to delegating responsibilities across departments and the coordination role of the Management Department reflects a commitment to embedding ESG principles in operations. However, the establishment of a dedicated ESG committee or the inclusion of ESG oversight as a key function of an existing committee would enhance its governance structure. These measures would ensure a more centralized and effective approach to managing its sustainability agenda.",0.7368421052631579,0.5999999993999999,0.0,0.9523809523809524,0.54,0.638280137147779

Specifically, it addresses the assessment of operations for risks related to corruption (Disclosure Indicator 205-1) and outlines the communication and training provided about these anti-corruption policies (Disclosure Indicator 205-2). 

However, the report does not provide evidence of implementation through specific cases addressed or outcomes achieved. Under Disclosure Indicator 205-3, it mentions that there were no confirmed incidents of corruption and actions taken, indicating that while the policies exist and are communicated, the absence of reported incidents suggests effective implementation or a lack of issues that required addressing. 

Overall, while the report discusses the framework for anti-corruption efforts, it lacks detailed examples or documented outcomes related to these policies in practice.","### **Anti-Corruption Policies and Implementation Evidence**

The ESG report of **Tairoun Products Co., Ltd.** outlines a comprehensive approach to ethical corporate management, detailing anti-corruption policies and providing evidence of their implementation. Below is a detailed analysis of the relevant aspects.

---

#### **Anti-Corruption Policies**

1. **Ethical Corporate Management Principles**:
   - Tairoun has adopted the **Ethical Corporate Management Best Practice Principles**, approved by the Board of Directors. These principles aim to regulate the behavior of directors, managers, and employees to prevent corruption, conflicts of interest, and improper benefits.

2. **Scope of Coverage**:
   - The policy explicitly prohibits bribery, acceptance of bribes, illegal political donations, improper charitable contributions, and receiving or giving improper gifts or hospitality. These measures are designed to mitigate risks associated with dishonest or unethical behavior.

3. **Employee Training**:
   - All employees undergo regular training to ensure awareness and compliance with these principles. Operational procedures and disciplinary systems are in place to reinforce adherence to ethical management standards.

---

#### **Evidence of Implementation**

1. **Internal Audits and Monitoring**:
   - An independent internal audit unit oversees the implementation of internal control systems and ensures compliance with anti-corruption policies. The audit unit reports to the Board of Directors and provides recommendations for continuous improvement.

2. **Compliance Record**:
   - In 2023, the report confirms **zero cases of violations** of the anti-bribery policy, legal disputes, or involvement in anti-competitive practices, antitrust issues, or monopolistic behavior. This demonstrates effective policy enforcement and monitoring.

3. **Corporate Training and Awareness**:
   - Regular training sessions are held for employees across operational sites to ensure they understand the importance of ethical behavior in corporate management. This includes guidelines for fair transactions, accurate reporting, and safeguarding company assets.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

##### **Strengths**:
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**:
   - The inclusion of specific prohibited behaviors and clear guidelines enhances the clarity and enforceability of the anti-corruption policy.

2. **Effective Monitoring**:
   - The internal audit mechanism ensures robust monitoring and compliance, with evidence of no reported violations.

3. **Transparent Reporting**:
   - The report provides a transparent overview of compliance outcomes, which enhances trust among stakeholders.

##### **Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Third-Party Verification**:
   - Including external assurance for anti-corruption measures could strengthen the credibility of compliance efforts.
   
2. **Detailed Case Reporting**:
   - While no violations were reported, the inclusion of anonymized case studies or examples of how potential issues were addressed could provide more depth to the report.

---

### **Conclusion**

Tairoun Products Co., Ltd. has established a robust framework for anti-corruption and ethical corporate management, supported by clear policies and comprehensive training programs. The report’s transparent disclosure of zero violations in 2023 reflects the effectiveness of these measures.

"Has the report undergone any form of verification or audit by a third party? If so, what does the verification process entail, and which parts of the report were validated?",[],"I don't have access to specific data sources regarding the verification or audit processes of the report you mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide details on whether the report has undergone third-party verification, the specifics of such a process, or which parts of the report may have been validated.

In general, third-party verification typically involves an independent organization reviewing the report to ensure accuracy, reliability, and adherence to certain standards. This process may include examining data collection methods, assessing the validity of the findings, and confirming that the report meets established criteria. However, the exact nature of the verification process can vary widely depending on the type of report and the standards in question.

If you can provide more context or details about the specific report, I may be able to offer more targeted information or general insights related to verification practices.","### **Third-Party Verification and Audit of the Report**

The company establishes a framework for sustainability that involves continuous improvement across various departments and aligns its strategies with long-term sustainability objectives. 

In terms of environmental sustainability, the company has made a bold commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. This goal is supported by the implementation of corporate environmental policies that focus on improving resource utilization efficiency, such as recycling water and waste, and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through energy transformation initiatives. The report notes the alignment with governmental efforts to promote GHG reduction quotas and trading mechanisms, which suggests a structured approach toward the company's environmental objectives.

The report also mentions several key areas of focus related to social responsibility, including employee care, workplace safety, and community engagement. While it highlights the importance of diverse talent recruitment and retention strategies, specific measurable targets for these social initiatives are not extensively detailed in the document. The company does emphasize the role of its management department in overseeing CSR issues, which indicates an internal mechanism for tracking and evaluating these strategies.

Overall, while Tairoun Products has articulated its sustainability ambitions and some strategies to achieve them, the report could benefit from more defined, measurable goals alongside detailed action plans to enhance transparency and accountability regarding its ESG objectives.","### **Future ESG Goals and Strategies**
