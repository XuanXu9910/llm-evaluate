This framework is internationally recognized for sustainability reporting and provides a comprehensive set of guidelines and principles to assist organizations in effectively communicating their economic, environmental, and social impacts. The report specifically references the GRI’s Sustainability Reporting Guide, emphasizing its commitment to transparency and accountability in corporate sustainable development.

In addition to following the GRI framework, the report demonstrates alignment with various reporting principles, such as stakeholder inclusiveness, sustainability context, and completeness, which are essential for comprehensive sustainability reporting. The identification of material issues within the report is systematically aligned with GRI standards, categorizing these issues into economic, social, and environmental segments. This structured approach ensures that the report addresses the concerns of stakeholders while reflecting the company’s sustainable development vision and strategy.

While the document does not explicitly mention other frameworks like SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) or TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures), the focus on GRI suggests a robust framework for sustainability reporting. The GRI is widely accepted and used globally, making it a credible choice for organizations aiming to meet international standards. Overall, Lucky Cement's report appears to align well with GRI guidelines, providing stakeholders with relevant insights into the company’s sustainability practices and performance.","#### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report**

The ESG report of Lucky Cement Corporation adheres to internationally recognized frameworks to ensure transparency, credibility, and alignment with global sustainability standards. The report explicitly references the following framework:

1. **Global Reporting Initiative (GRI):**
   - The report is prepared based on the **Standards Edition-Sustainability Reporting Guide** issued by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The GRI framework emphasizes materiality, stakeholder inclusiveness, and sustainability context, ensuring that the report addresses the most relevant ESG issues for the company and its stakeholders.

2. **ISO Standards:**
   - The company follows ISO 14064 standards for greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory and verification, demonstrating its commitment to environmental management and emission reduction.

---

#### **Alignment with the Frameworks**

Lucky Cement Corporation has demonstrated a robust alignment with the referenced frameworks, particularly GRI and ISO standards. Key aspects of this alignment include:

1. **Materiality and Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - The report systematically identifies material ESG issues in accordance with GRI Standards, guided by reporting principles such as stakeholder inclusiveness and the sustainability context. It outlines the concerns of key stakeholders—employees, clients, suppliers, investors, and community residents—and provides clear communication channels and responses to these concerns.

2. **Third-Party Verification:**
   - The company ensures credibility by obtaining third-party verification for its GHG inventory. For instance, the Dongao Plant's emissions were verified by SGS, meeting ISO 14064 requirements. Such verification strengthens stakeholder confidence in the reported data.

3. **Sustainability Goals and Performance Metrics:**
   - The company integrates its sustainability strategy with measurable targets, such as reducing GHG emissions by more than 10% compared to the base year of 2013. It transparently discloses its progress toward these goals, aligning with GRI principles of accountability and comparability.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - **Framework Compliance:** The report adheres to the GRI Standards and ISO frameworks, demonstrating a clear commitment to internationally recognized sustainability practices.
   - **Verification:** External third-party verification of GHG emissions enhances credibility and compliance with ISO standards.
   - **Detailed Reporting:** The inclusion of quantitative metrics, such as GHG emissions reductions and waste recycling volumes, aligns well with GRI's emphasis on data-driven disclosures.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Expansion of Frameworks:** The report could further align with additional frameworks such as the **Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)** or the **Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)** to enhance climate risk reporting and industry-specific metrics.
   - **Stakeholder Engagement Depth:** While the report identifies stakeholder concerns, deeper analysis or case studies of how these concerns were specifically addressed could improve transparency.
   - **SDG Integration:** Explicit mapping of the company’s contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) would provide a clearer context for its sustainability initiatives.

---

In conclusion, Lucky Cement Corporation's ESG report demonstrates strong alignment with the GRI and ISO frameworks, with a well-structured approach to materiality, stakeholder engagement, and quantitative performance reporting. However, expanding to include other globally recognized frameworks and providing more granular details on stakeholder engagement and SDG contributions could further enhance the report’s comprehensiveness and global relevance.",0.2727272727272727,0.071428571377551,0.5616676409579967,1.0,0.58,0.8353872441580588

The report covers the period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. It is designed to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the company’s commitment to sustainable development.

In terms of organizational scope, the report is compiled based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, specifically addressing the company’s important operating locations and sustainability management performance. However, while it outlines the general framework for reporting, it does not explicitly detail the specific subsidiaries or parts of the company included in the report. Instead, it emphasizes the overall approach to stakeholder communication, material issues, and governance without providing a granular breakdown of the organizational entities involved in the reporting process. 

Overall, while the report sets a solid foundation in terms of time frame and scope, further specifics regarding subsidiaries or supply chains would require additional information or references to the company's annual report for a thorough understanding.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The Lucky Cement Corporation’s ESG report clearly defines its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring transparency and clarity for stakeholders.

1. **Time Frame:**
   - The report specifies that it covers the period from **January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023**. This ensures that the data and disclosures provided are confined to a single fiscal year, allowing stakeholders to assess performance and compare it against prior periods.
   - The next scheduled issue of the ESG report is in **June 2025**, adhering to an annual reporting cycle. This reflects the company’s commitment to regular and timely sustainability reporting.

2. **Organizational Scope:**
   - The report covers Lucky Cement Corporation’s **three main operating locations** and includes its **subsidiaries, supply chain, and other operations** integral to its business. Specifically:
     - **Production Bases:** Dongao Plant, Heren Plant, and Puxin Plant.
     - **Storage and Transportation Bases:** Four facilities located in Hualien County, Taichung City, Kaohsiung City, and Wudu District in Keelung City.
     - **Business Offices:** Six locations across Taiwan in Yilan County, Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hualien County, Taichung City, and Kaohsiung City.

3. **Inclusion of Supply Chain:**
   - The report highlights the inclusion of **supply chain management practices**, encompassing supplier evaluation, audits, and adherence to ethical and environmental standards. For instance, the company’s Supplier Code of Conduct covers labor rights, safety, and environmental compliance, which applies to 360 suppliers who have signed a commitment to these principles.

4. **Data Sources:**
   - The report specifies that its financial data are sourced from publicly published financial reports certified by accountants, and other statistical data are derived from government agencies and industry sources. This ensures accuracy and traceability of the information provided.

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - **Clear Time Frame:** The report explicitly defines the reporting period, ensuring clarity for stakeholders.
   - **Comprehensive Scope:** The inclusion of production bases, supply chains, and subsidiaries demonstrates a holistic approach to ESG reporting.
   - **Transparency of Data Sources:** Clearly stating the origin of data enhances the credibility and reliability of the report.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**

   - Greater emphasis on the **scope of upstream and downstream supply chain impacts** would strengthen the report’s comprehensiveness.

The impact of a circular economy: \n\nThe promotion of a circular economy needs to rely on the active actions of the government. Although  the  government  currently  lists  circular  economy  as  its  future  policy,  the  aspects  of \n\ntechnology, economy, society, politics, and related laws and regulations are incomplete, leading to \n\ninformation  asymmetry  between the central  government,  local  governments,  academia, and the \n\ngeneral public. In the future, the government still needs to formulate relevant laws and regulations \n\nfor  the  development  of  circular  economy,  and  strengthen  the  concepts  of  energy  and  resource \n\nrecycling, source reduction, and green design and production. Commitment: \n\nUnder the conditions of compliance with the relevant certificates and documents for reuse \n\nissued  by  the  county  government,  the  Company  will  strive  to  assist  the  government,  industrial \n\nparks  and  enterprises  to  convert  waste  into  supplies  and  fuels  required  by  the  Company's \n\nmanufacturing processes. Management system or practices: \n\nHandle various waste energy and resources recycling processes in accordance with the \n\nWaste Disposal Act. Goals and targets: \n\n1. The waste is redefined and returned to the industry production chain for continuous circulation, \n\nreducing the consumption of primary energy and resources. 2."", ""page|source|page_content\n39|./esg_report/LUCKY_CEMENT.pdf|reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Recycling and reuse of waste resources \n\n        The upper reaches of Gaoping River, the water source of greater Kaohsiung area, was polluted \n\nby malicious dumping of suspected waste organic solvents, which caused the Kaohsiung area to \n\nshut down the water supply. The random dumping of inorganic wastes in the valleys also greatly \n\nharmed  the  environment. Environmental  protection  issues  have  become  the  focus  of  national \n\nattention in Taiwan. The use of cement kilns in the cement industry process to treat part of the \n\nindustrial waste can immediately reduce the domestic pressure of waste disposal.

Their recruitment policies are designed to ensure fairness and impartiality, with a clear commitment to avoiding discrimination based on gender, age, marital status, facial features, race, and religion. This foundational approach to recruitment underscores their dedication to creating a diverse workforce. 

In terms of internal policies, the company has established various initiatives aimed at enhancing employee welfare and promoting a harmonious work culture. This includes an internal job rotation model to utilize the diverse talents of employees effectively and a structured employee training program that includes new employee training, on-the-job training, and professional development. The goal of these initiatives is to foster a workplace that not only supports diversity but also nurtures the growth of all employees, aligning with the company's broader mission and vision.

While the report outlines the commitment to DEI through these policies, it does not provide specific data regarding gender or minority representation within the workforce. Instead, the focus appears to be on creating an equitable environment where all employees have opportunities for development and advancement. The company also regularly engages in employee-employer meetings to address and coordinate labor relations, which can contribute to a more inclusive workplace culture.

Overall, while the company's policies reflect a strong commitment to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, more specific data regarding the representation of various demographics would enhance the understanding of their current DEI landscape.","#### **Policies and Initiatives for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion**

Lucky Cement Corporation emphasizes its commitment to employee diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as part of its broader human resources management and corporate sustainability goals. The company's ESG report outlines several policies and initiatives aimed at fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace, supported by specific practices and data.

---

1. **Recruitment and Non-Discrimination Policies:**
   - Lucky Cement adopts open, fair, and impartial recruitment processes, assigning roles and remuneration based on factors such as academic qualifications, professional licenses, work experience, and work attitudes. 
   - The company explicitly prohibits discrimination based on gender, age, marital status, appearance, race, or religion. This adherence to non-discrimination aligns with government labor laws and reflects a commitment to equity in recruitment and employment practices.

---

2. **Employee Composition:**
   - The report provides gender distribution data across different operational units:
     - Male employees constitute 80% of the workforce, while female employees represent 20%.
     - Specific facilities have varying gender ratios, such as 67% male and 33% female in Taipei, and 90% male and 10% female in the Dongao Plant.
   - Although these figures highlight the existing gender imbalance, the transparency in reporting underscores the company’s awareness of diversity metrics.

---

3. **Diversity Goals and Workforce Development:**
   - Lucky Cement has outlined goals to enhance employee diversity and move toward globalization, systematically cultivating management associates to achieve these aims.
   - Training and promotion systems are designed to foster talent development while supporting diversity in career advancement opportunities. These programs include new employee training, on-the-job training, and professional knowledge training.

---

4. **Employee Engagement and Inclusion:**
   - The company ensures employees' freedom of association and supports labor union activities to facilitate harmonious employer-employee relationships. At the Dongao Plant, the presence of a labor union underscores this commitment to worker representation and collaboration.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - **Commitment to Non-Discrimination:** Clear policies against discrimination based on personal characteristics reflect adherence to international labor standards and government regulations.
   - **Transparency in Gender Representation:** Providing gender data by unit highlights a willingness to address workforce diversity.
   - **Training and Development:** Comprehensive employee training and promotion systems contribute to inclusive talent development.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Gender Representation:** While transparency in reporting is commendable, efforts to address gender imbalances, particularly in operational roles, need to be more explicitly outlined.
   - **Minority and Global Diversity:** The report does not provide detailed metrics or strategies related to minority representation or cultural diversity within the workforce.
   - **Quantifiable DEI Targets:** Setting measurable DEI goals, such as increasing the percentage of female employees or minority representation over time, would strengthen the company’s commitment to inclusivity.

In conclusion, Lucky Cement demonstrates a strong foundation for diversity, equity, and inclusion through its recruitment policies, training programs, and transparent reporting practices. However, addressing existing gender imbalances and establishing quantifiable diversity targets would further align the company with best practices in DEI and enhance stakeholder confidence in its commitment to an inclusive workplace.",0.6153846153846154,0.0,0.8539908762356087,0.4285714285714285,0.56,0.7466264608499033

One of the primary commitments is adherence to the relevant government regulations concerning labor rights, which prohibit forced labor and child labor. The company has a clear stance against discrimination based on gender, age, race, or religion, ensuring fair treatment for all employees. This is reinforced through comprehensive recruitment practices that focus on fairness and impartiality, where remuneration and work assignments are based on qualifications and work attitudes rather than discriminatory factors.

In terms of ensuring fair labor practices, the company actively promotes a Supplier Code of Conduct that has been in place since 2016. This code emphasizes collaboration with suppliers to commit to sustainable development and ethical practices, covering labor rights, safety, and health. As of the end of 2023, 360 suppliers had signed this code, indicating a broad commitment to human rights across the supply chain. Additionally, the report mentions regular audits and compliance checks conducted on suppliers to evaluate their adherence to these standards. This includes on-site inspections, coaching, and tracking of suppliers’ practices to ensure they align with the company's ethical commitments and labor rights standards.

Moreover, the company has implemented a robust internal policy for employee grievances and communication channels, allowing employees to voice concerns regarding labor practices, including forced and compulsory labor or incidents of harassment. The absence of reported complaints in 2023 reflects the effectiveness of these measures. Employee training on human rights policies and procedures is also part of the company's commitment to fostering a workplace that respects and upholds the rights of all workers.

Overall, the report illustrates a comprehensive framework aimed at safeguarding human rights and ensuring fair labor practices through strict adherence to regulations, regular audits, and proactive engagement with both employees and suppliers.","#### **Human Rights and Labor Practices**

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - **Comprehensive Supplier Oversight:** The Supplier Code of Conduct and associated audits ensure high standards of human rights and labor practices throughout the supply chain.
   - **Employee Grievance Channels:** Accessible and effective mechanisms for employees to voice concerns reflect the company’s commitment to workplace fairness.
   - **Proactive Auditing:** Regular inspections and follow-up actions enhance accountability and compliance across operations and suppliers.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Enhanced Reporting on Audit Outcomes:** Providing detailed statistics on audit results and the number of suppliers requiring corrective actions could enhance transparency.
   - **Human Rights Metrics:** Quantitative indicators on human rights impacts and labor conditions, such as incident rates or the number of grievances resolved, would add depth to disclosures.
   - **Expanded Scope:** Including detailed reporting on risks of forced labor or child labor in high-risk regions within the supply chain could strengthen the company’s human rights strategy.

In conclusion, Lucky Cement Corporation’s ESG report reflects a strong commitment to human rights and fair labor practices, supported by well-structured codes, audits, and grievance mechanisms. Expanding the scope of reporting and providing quantitative metrics would further align the company with leading practices in human rights management.",1.0,0.1052631578393351,0.6180330410237223,1.0,0.74,0.8497686143653425

While it does not provide specific training programs, it emphasizes a dual approach to development, encompassing both workplace and external opportunities. Each supervisor is responsible for creating and implementing individualized employee development plans, which suggests a tailored approach to training that can cater to the specific needs of employees.

Additionally, the company incorporates a dual-track promotion system, which allows employees to advance based on their skills and competencies rather than solely on hierarchical progression. This system is designed to systematically cultivate management associates and supports the company’s diversity and globalization goals. Moreover, the establishment of promotion qualification requirements indicates an organized effort to ensure that employees are adequately prepared for career advancement.

This committee was rebranded from the original Corporate Social Responsibility Committee on May 12, 2021, to align with the government's Corporate Governance 3.0 - Sustainable Development Blueprint. The ESG Committee is chaired by directors of the company, including two independent directors, which underscores its significance and accountability at the executive level.

The primary responsibilities of the ESG Committee include formulating corporate sustainable development policies and systems, deliberating on annual plans and strategic directions, reviewing sustainable development projects, and overseeing corporate sustainable development reports. The committee also engages in public affairs related to sustainability, ensuring that its initiatives are aligned with stakeholder expectations and the company’s broader objectives. Furthermore, the committee's discussions and resolutions are recorded and subsequently implemented by the relevant departments within the company, integrating these sustainability efforts into the operational framework of the organization.

In terms of governance structures, the ESG Committee operates under the board of directors, ensuring that sustainability is a key focus at the highest levels of corporate governance. The company also has a part-time corporate sustainable development unit that assists in revising related measures and is responsible for preparing sustainability reports. This layered approach to governance facilitates the integration of sustainability into the company's strategic objectives while also promoting transparency and accountability through regular reporting and stakeholder engagement. Overall, the governance structure reflects a commitment to sustainable development as an integral component of the company's overarching business strategy.","#### **ESG Committee and Governance**

   - The company's greenhouse gas emissions are subject to third-party verification in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14064 standards. This ensures compliance with international guidelines for greenhouse gas accounting and verification.
   - For 2023, the emissions data from Lucky Cement's Dongao Plant were verified by an external certification body. The verification process confirmed total greenhouse gas emissions of 585,048 tons of CO2e, representing a 22.95% reduction compared to the 2013 base year.

---

2. **Audit of Internal Control Systems:**
   - The company’s Audit Department conducts regular evaluations of its internal control systems, guided by a risk assessment framework. The annual audit plan is reviewed and approved by the board of directors and includes monthly audit items. This approach aims to ensure operational efficiency, reliable reporting, and regulatory compliance.
   - Internal control systems are subject to an annual assessment of their design and implementation effectiveness. The findings are summarized in an internal control statement, which is reviewed by independent directors and disclosed publicly.

---

3. **Application of GRI Standards:**
   - The report is compiled following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, ensuring alignment with internationally recognized sustainability reporting frameworks. This approach enhances the consistency and comparability of the disclosed information.

---

4. **Scope and Limitations of Verification:**
   - The third-party verification mainly focuses on environmental performance metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions. Financial data referenced in the report are derived from publicly certified financial reports and annual reports, but these are not explicitly covered by third-party verification.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - **Comprehensive Verification:** Third-party verification of greenhouse gas emissions adds credibility to the company’s environmental disclosures.
   - **Regular Audits:** The structured internal control audits provide a solid governance framework to ensure operational and reporting reliability.
   - **Adherence to International Standards:** Alignment with GRI Standards reflects the company’s commitment to global best practices in ESG reporting.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Expansion of Verification Scope:** Including social and governance metrics in the scope of third-party verification could enhance stakeholder trust in the overall ESG disclosures.
   - **Enhanced Disclosure on Verification Processes:** Providing more details about the third-party auditors, their methodologies, and the specific areas of focus would improve transparency.

The report emphasizes the integration of economic, social, and environmental aspects into their operations, indicating a holistic approach to sustainable development.

The report sets clear targets, such as maintaining a customer satisfaction score above 90 points, which is a measurable goal under the economic aspect. Additionally, the company has articulated broader objectives, such as continuing to save energy, reducing carbon emissions, and improving resource utilization. However, while these goals are commendable, the report does not delve deeply into the specific strategies or detailed action plans necessary to achieve them.

Moreover, the report mentions the establishment of a Corporate Sustainable Development Committee, which is responsible for formulating sustainable development policies and reviewing project plans. This indicates that there is an organizational structure in place to oversee and guide the ESG efforts. However, the document could benefit from more explicit strategies, timelines, and metrics related to the achievement of these goals.

In summary, while the report does outline the company's future ESG aspirations and includes some measurable targets, it lacks comprehensive details on the specific strategies and plans that will be employed to meet these objectives. The overall commitment to sustainable practices is apparent, but enhanced transparency regarding the execution of these goals would strengthen stakeholder confidence.","#### **Future ESG Goals and Strategies**
