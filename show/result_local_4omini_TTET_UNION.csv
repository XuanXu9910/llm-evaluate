The ESG report prepared by TTET Union Corporation adheres to several internationally recognized frameworks, primarily the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards, and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. These frameworks are designed to enhance transparency and accountability in sustainability reporting, allowing organizations to effectively communicate their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.

### Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)

The GRI Standards are a comprehensive set of guidelines that help organizations report on their economic, environmental, and social impacts. TTET Union Corp. specifically follows the GRI Standards 2021 Version for its sustainability reporting, ensuring that its disclosures align with the latest guidelines issued by the GRI [Data: Entities (25), Relationships (99, 110, 133)]. The GRI framework is widely recognized and utilized globally, making it a credible choice for organizations aiming to enhance their sustainability reporting.

### Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB)

In addition to GRI, TTET Union Corp. utilizes SASB standards for its sustainability reporting. SASB develops standards that help public corporations disclose material, decision-useful information to investors, focusing on industry-specific sustainability issues [Data: Entities (117), Relationships (175)]. This alignment with SASB standards further strengthens the report's relevance and utility for stakeholders, particularly investors.

### Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)

The organizational scope and time frame of the Sustainability Report published by TTET Union Corporation are indeed defined. The report covers the company's sustainable development efforts and results from 2013 to 2022, providing a comprehensive overview of its initiatives during this period [Data: Entities (14); Relationships (100)]. 

### Inclusion of Company Parts

However, the report does not explicitly specify the parts of the company, such as subsidiaries or supply chains, that are included in the reporting scope. While it mentions the Sustainable Development Management Organization, which oversees and promotes sustainable development initiatives within the company, there is no detailed breakdown of specific subsidiaries or supply chain components included in the report [Data: Entities (29); Relationships (104)]. 

### Conclusion

In summary, while the time frame of the report is clearly defined, the organizational scope regarding specific parts of the company is not explicitly detailed. This lack of specificity may limit stakeholders' understanding of the full extent of the company's sustainability practices across its various operations.","### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the TTET Union Corporation ESG Report**

#### **Defined Scope of the Report**
The TTET Union Corporation ESG report provides a clear definition of its organizational scope, specifying that the report covers the sustainability performance of TTET Union Corporation as an individual entity. This ensures clarity for stakeholders about the specific aspects of the company being evaluated.

- The report includes data primarily from TTET Union Corporation itself, with most indicators reflecting internal operations. It explicitly notes that the statistical data disclosed are the results of internal surveys and calculations.
- Regarding subsidiaries or supply chain elements, the report mentions that data from the company’s subsidiaries or supply chains are not the primary focus unless specified. For example, supply chain management and supplier environmental and social assessments are discussed, but operational data focus on TTET Union Corporation's direct activities.

#### **Time Frame of the Report**
The time frame covered by the report is explicitly stated as January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. Additionally, the report indicates that for certain material issues, data from periods prior to 2023 or beyond may also be included to provide completeness in disclosure.

- The report clearly differentiates between the reporting period and previous reports, stating there are no significant differences in scope or restatements compared to the 2022 report. This consistency ensures stakeholders can effectively compare performance across reporting periods.

#### **Inclusion of Subsidiaries and Supply Chain**
While the report primarily focuses on TTET Union Corporation, it touches on supply chain elements in specific contexts, such as:
- **Supplier Management Policies:** The report highlights evaluations and quality control measures for suppliers, particularly in sourcing raw materials like soybeans and packaging materials.
- **Sustainability Assurance Protocol:** The company collaborates with U.S. soybean suppliers under the Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol (SSAP), integrating sustainability considerations into its supply chain practices.

#### **Strengths in Scope Definition**
1. **Clear Organizational Boundaries:** By limiting the scope primarily to TTET Union Corporation, the report provides precise and focused disclosures, avoiding ambiguities about the entities included.
2. **Defined Time Frame:** The consistent application of a clear reporting period enables stakeholders to track year-over-year performance effectively.

#### **Areas for Improvement**
1. **Subsidiary Inclusion:** The report could benefit from more detailed disclosures about subsidiaries like Master Channels Corporation, which contributes to food distribution and wholesale operations.
2. **Supply Chain Transparency:** Expanding the depth of disclosures on the environmental and social impacts of supply chain operations would strengthen the report’s comprehensiveness.

### **Conclusion**
The TTET Union Corporation ESG report effectively defines its organizational scope and time frame, ensuring stakeholders can clearly understand the coverage of its disclosures. However, further elaboration on subsidiary contributions and deeper insights into supply chain sustainability impacts could enhance the report’s transparency and utility.",1.0,,0.0,1.0,0.34,0.8173310007008072

The Sustainability Report prepared by TTET Union Corporation includes a comprehensive overview of the company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. This report not only presents current data but also references historical performance metrics, particularly from the years 2013 to 2022, to illustrate trends and progress over time. The transition from the Corporate Social Responsibility Report to the Sustainability Report in 2021 signifies a renewed focus on sustainability, which is reflected in the data comparisons made within the report [Data: Entities (14); Relationships (96)].

### Meaningfulness and Transparency of Comparisons

The comparisons made in the Sustainability Report are designed to be meaningful and transparent. The report adheres to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, which emphasize the importance of transparency in sustainability reporting. By following these established guidelines, TTET Union Corp. ensures that the data presented is not only accurate but also comparable across different reporting periods. This adherence to GRI Standards enhances the credibility of the comparisons made, allowing stakeholders to assess the company's progress effectively [Data: Entities (24, 8); Relationships (110, 133)].

Furthermore, the inclusion of Enhanced Disclosure Matters in the report aims to provide additional context and insights into the company's sustainability practices. This initiative encourages a more detailed reporting approach, which contributes to the overall transparency of the comparisons made between current and historical ESG performance data [Data: Entities (10); Relationships (120)].

### Conclusion

In summary, the Sustainability Report by TTET Union Corporation does compare current ESG performance data with historical data, highlighting trends and progress over time. The meaningfulness and transparency of these comparisons are bolstered by adherence to GRI Standards and the inclusion of Enhanced Disclosure Matters, ensuring that stakeholders receive a comprehensive view of the company's sustainability journey [Data: Entities (7, 922); Relationships (98, 521)].","### **Analysis of ESG Performance Data Comparison in the TTET Union Corporation ESG Report**

#### **Inclusion of Historical Data for Performance Comparison**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report incorporates historical data in several areas, providing a basis for tracking progress and identifying trends over time. These comparisons are presented transparently and focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) across environmental, social, and governance dimensions.

1. **Environmental Performance:**
   - The report provides data on energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and waste reduction measures. For example, the total energy savings in 2023 were reported as approximately 551.69 kWh, resulting in an estimated reduction of 272,535 kg of CO2e emissions. Although the report outlines this achievement, a detailed year-over-year comparison of energy efficiency or emissions reductions would enhance visibility into long-term trends.

2. **Economic Performance:**
   - Financial data, including operating revenue, costs, and pre-tax profits, are compared over three years (2021-2023). For example, the report highlights a decrease in operating revenue from NT$20.217 billion in 2022 to NT$18.488 billion in 2023, attributing the decline to reduced market demand and macroeconomic challenges.

3. **Food Safety and Product Quality:**
   - Certifications such as ISO 9001 and ISO 22000 are linked to product quality metrics. The report mentions that 97.06% of the net sales in 2023 came from products manufactured under certified systems, but historical comparisons for these certifications are not detailed, limiting trend analysis.

4. **Social Contributions:**
   - Workforce data, such as employee nationality (100% local employees in 2023) and the absence of foreign workers, are consistent year-over-year. However, metrics related to employee diversity, talent cultivation, or workplace satisfaction do not include historical trends.

---

#### **Meaningfulness of Comparisons**

The comparisons presented in the report are meaningful in several areas but could be enhanced to provide deeper insights:

1. **Strengths:**
   - Multi-year financial data enable stakeholders to assess economic resilience and identify trends in profitability and revenue performance.
   - Environmental performance metrics, such as energy savings and GHG reductions, demonstrate incremental progress toward sustainability goals.

2. **Areas for Enhancement:**
   - The report does not consistently use visual tools like graphs or tables to illustrate trends, which could improve accessibility and clarity.
   - Comparisons for social and governance metrics, such as employee engagement, diversity, or governance effectiveness, are limited or absent.

---

#### **Transparency in Reporting**

The report ensures transparency by disclosing the basis for its data and clarifying methodologies. For example, financial data is derived from audited financial statements, while environmental metrics are tied to ISO standards. Limited assurance by PwC Taiwan further enhances credibility. However, the lack of clear baseline data for some ESG initiatives, such as waste management or supplier compliance, reduces the ability to track progress comprehensively.

---

### **Conclusion**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report provides some comparisons of current performance with historical data, primarily in financial and environmental areas. While these comparisons are meaningful and transparent, expanding the scope of historical data across all ESG dimensions and visualizing trends would significantly enhance stakeholder understanding. Consistent inclusion of year-over-year data for social and governance metrics would also support a more holistic assessment of the company’s sustainability progress.",0.6,0.1874999998828125,0.7455365711550895,0.1923076923076923,0.19,0.8798273846623299

The report from TTET Union Corporation provides detailed quantifiable data on the company's carbon emissions, specifically addressing Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 emissions refer to direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by the organization, while Scope 2 emissions encompass indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the organization. The report includes verified data for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, ensuring a comprehensive overview of the company's emissions profile [Data: GHG EMISSIONS (7); DIRECT (SCOPE 1) GHG EMISSIONS (864); INDIRECT (SCOPE 2) GHG EMISSIONS (865); GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (188); GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY (34)].

### Verification of Emissions Data

The emissions data reported by TTET Union Corporation undergoes external verification to ensure accuracy and compliance with established standards. This verification process is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the reported figures and is conducted by third-party organizations. The verification includes assessments of the greenhouse gas emissions inventory, which covers the emissions data for the years mentioned above [Data: EXTERNAL VERIFICATION (556); GREENHOUSE GAS ASSURANCE (935); GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (1090); GHG EMISSIONS DATA (1090); ISO 14064-1:2018 (547)].

### Scope 3 Emissions

However, the report does not explicitly mention Scope 3 emissions, which typically include all other indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain, such as those from suppliers and product use. The absence of data on Scope 3 emissions suggests that the company may not currently be tracking or reporting these metrics, which is a common practice among many organizations as they work towards comprehensive sustainability reporting.

In summary, TTET Union Corporation provides quantifiable data on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, with third-party verification ensuring the reliability of these metrics. The lack of information on Scope 3 emissions indicates an area for potential improvement in their sustainability reporting practices.","### **Analysis of Carbon Emissions Reporting in the TTET Union Corporation ESG Report**

#### **Quantifiable Carbon Emissions Data**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report includes quantifiable data on the company’s carbon emissions, primarily focused on Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. These metrics are part of the company's broader climate strategy and environmental management systems. However, there is no detailed mention of Scope 3 emissions in the report.

1. **Scope 1 and Scope 2 Emissions:**
   - The company provides data related to its energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. For example, it highlights that energy-saving measures implemented in 2023 resulted in electricity savings equivalent to a reduction of 272,535 kg of CO2e emissions.
   - TTET Union Corporation has adopted ISO 14064-1 standards, which govern the quantification and reporting of GHG emissions and removals, indicating a structured approach to emissions management.

2. **Scope 3 Emissions:**
   - The report does not explicitly disclose Scope 3 emissions, such as those arising from the supply chain, employee commuting, or the use of sold products. This omission limits the comprehensiveness of the company’s carbon footprint analysis.

---

#### **Verification of Carbon Emissions Data**

The report specifies that TTET Union Corporation engages in third-party assurance to verify its sustainability disclosures. Key points regarding verification include:

1. **Third-Party Verification:**
   - The company engaged PwC Taiwan to conduct limited assurance in accordance with TWSAE 3000 standards. This assurance applies to the environmental data, including energy consumption and GHG reductions, enhancing the reliability of these disclosures.

2. **Alignment with Standards:**
   - The adoption of ISO 14064-1 for GHG reporting aligns with international best practices. However, the scope and details of the third-party verification specific to GHG data are not fully outlined in the report.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The report provides quantified GHG data for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, demonstrating the company’s commitment to measuring and managing its direct and indirect carbon footprint.
   - The use of ISO 14064-1 and third-party assurance by PwC Taiwan lends credibility to the emissions data.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Scope 3 Emissions:** Expanding disclosures to include Scope 3 emissions would provide a more comprehensive picture of the company’s carbon footprint, particularly given its reliance on an international supply chain.
   - **Granularity of Data:** Providing year-over-year emissions data and using graphs or tables to illustrate trends would improve clarity and allow stakeholders to assess progress more effectively.
   - **Verification Details:** Greater transparency on the specific aspects of carbon emissions data covered under third-party verification would enhance stakeholder confidence.

---

### **Conclusion**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report provides quantified data for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, verified by third-party assurance, reflecting a structured approach to carbon management. However, the absence of Scope 3 emissions and limited detail on verification processes represent areas for improvement.

#### **Overview of Water Resource Management**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report highlights the company’s commitment to sustainable environmental management, including water resource conservation. However, while the report briefly mentions water-related practices, it lacks comprehensive quantitative data on water usage, recycling rates, and reduction measures.

---

#### **Water Usage**

The report identifies water management as an essential component of the company’s sustainability strategy. However, it does not provide specific data on:
- **Total Water Consumption:** No quantitative figures are disclosed regarding the volume of water used in operations.
- **Sources of Water:** Information on whether water is sourced from municipal supplies, groundwater, or other means is absent.
- **Water Intensity:** Metrics reflecting water usage relative to production output are not provided, limiting the ability to assess efficiency improvements.

---

#### **Recycling Rates**

The report does not explicitly discuss water recycling initiatives or provide data on the percentage of water recycled and reused within operations. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate the company’s efforts to promote circular water usage or reduce its reliance on freshwater resources.

---

#### **Measures to Reduce Water Consumption**

While TTET Union Corporation emphasizes resource conservation, the report does not detail specific initiatives or technologies implemented to reduce water consumption. Best practices such as water-efficient processes, leak detection systems, or employee engagement programs to reduce water waste are not described.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The report acknowledges water resource management as an area of focus within its environmental sustainability efforts.
   - Commitments to ISO 14001 environmental management systems indirectly support sustainable water use practices.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Quantitative Data:** Include detailed metrics on total water usage, recycling rates, and water intensity to enhance transparency and accountability.
   - **Recycling Practices:** Provide information on water recycling and reuse initiatives, including measurable goals and progress.
   - **Reduction Measures:** Detail specific actions or technologies employed to reduce water consumption across operations.
   - **Year-Over-Year Comparisons:** Include historical water usage data to highlight trends and improvements over time.

---

### **Conclusion**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report touches on the importance of water resource management but lacks the detailed data and disclosures necessary for a thorough evaluation. Providing quantitative metrics on water usage, recycling rates, and reduction measures, along with specific initiatives to conserve water, would significantly strengthen the report’s transparency and demonstrate the company’s commitment to sustainable water practices.",0.8823529411764706,0.0,0.6436776201608457,1.0,0.14,0.8540894613051948

#### **Overview of Waste Management**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report demonstrates a commitment to waste management, focusing on waste reduction, recycling, and the integration of circular economy principles. However, while several initiatives are highlighted, the report provides limited measurable data to evaluate the outcomes of these strategies fully.

---

#### **Waste Reduction Strategies**

1. **Focus on Operational Efficiency:**
   - The company integrates ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems) to guide its waste management practices, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations and promoting resource efficiency.
   - Specific measures include the lightweighting of packaging materials. For example:
     - Changes to 2.6L and 3.0L oil bottles from double to single labels saved approximately 1.46 million labels annually, reducing material use by about 3.5 tons.
   - These efforts align with the company's goal of minimizing waste generation during production and packaging.

2. **Monitoring and Compliance:**
   - TTET Union Corporation adheres to strict environmental standards for waste disposal, ensuring that operations meet regulatory requirements. However, detailed metrics on overall waste reduction volumes or percentages are not disclosed.

---

#### **Recycling Initiatives**

1. **Material Reuse:**
   - The report briefly mentions the recycling of white carbon sludge and its reuse as part of the company’s environmental initiatives. This reflects a commitment to finding secondary applications for industrial by-products.

2. **Circular Economy Practices:**
   - Although the concept of a circular economy is not explicitly referenced, the recycling of materials such as white carbon sludge demonstrates an alignment with circular principles. The report could benefit from broader disclosures on additional recycling or reuse initiatives, especially for other waste streams.

3. **Packaging Improvements:**
   - Lightweight packaging innovations contribute indirectly to waste reduction by reducing the volume of materials used.

---

#### **Measurable Results and Disclosures**

1. **Limited Quantitative Data:**
   - While the report provides examples of waste reduction initiatives (e.g., savings from packaging optimizations), it lacks comprehensive, measurable data on:
     - Total waste generated and recycled.
     - Waste diversion rates (e.g., percentage of waste diverted from landfills).
     - Progress over time in waste management metrics.

2. **Historical Comparisons:**
   - The absence of year-over-year comparisons or trends for waste metrics limits the ability to assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Integration of ISO 14001 ensures a systematic approach to waste management.
   - Specific initiatives, such as lightweight packaging and the recycling of white carbon sludge, highlight a proactive approach to reducing waste and promoting resource efficiency.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Quantifiable Metrics:** Include comprehensive data on waste generated, recycled, and diverted, along with progress against targets.
   - **Circular Economy Integration:** Expand disclosures to include a broader range of circular economy practices and initiatives.
   - **Year-Over-Year Analysis:** Provide historical data to demonstrate progress and identify trends in waste management performance.

---

### **Conclusion**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report outlines several waste management strategies, focusing on operational efficiency, recycling, and material optimization. While these initiatives reflect a commitment to sustainable practices, the lack of measurable data and comprehensive disclosures limits the ability to evaluate the results effectively. Incorporating quantifiable metrics and broader circular economy strategies would significantly enhance transparency and demonstrate the company’s progress in waste management.",0.9285714285714286,0.0666666666222222,0.7662174306853192,1.0,0.37,0.7997498133934295

#### **Overview of Climate-Related Risk Assessment**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report identifies climate change as a critical factor affecting its operations and outlines various risks associated with extreme weather events and regulatory changes. The company adopts a structured approach to managing these risks through established frameworks and operational practices.

---

#### **Identification of Climate-Related Risks**

1. **Extreme Weather Events:**
   - The report acknowledges the potential impacts of extreme weather on its operations, including disruptions to supply chains, damage to facilities, and operational downtime. 
   - Specific measures, such as the use of backup systems (e.g., water tankers and emergency generators), are cited as contingency plans to address these risks.

2. **Regulatory Changes:**
   - The report highlights the risks associated with evolving climate-related regulations, including carbon taxes and the shift toward renewable energy requirements. These regulatory changes may impact operational costs and require adjustments in production processes.

3. **Financial Implications:**
   - Climate-related financial risks include fluctuations in raw material prices due to climate-induced agricultural impacts and the need to invest in renewable energy solutions to comply with emerging regulations.

---

#### **Risk Management Strategies**

1. **Governance and Strategic Integration:**
   - Climate risk management is embedded within the company’s broader sustainability strategy, overseen by its Sustainable Development Management Organization.
   - The adoption of ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 provides a structured framework for assessing and mitigating environmental risks, including those related to climate change.

2. **Proactive Measures:**
   - To address the transition risks associated with carbon taxes and renewable energy requirements, the company has begun:
     - Purchasing renewable energy certificates.
     - Developing low-carbon products and services.
   - Physical risks from extreme weather are mitigated through insurance policies, such as business interruption and product liability coverage, ensuring financial protection against operational disruptions.

3. **Climate Resilience:**
   - The company has established a crisis management team, which includes senior leadership across various departments, to oversee responses to climate-related events. This team conducts regular evaluations of risks and implements preventive measures.

---

#### **Disclosures and Transparency**

1. **Quantitative Data:**
   - The report provides specific examples of GHG reductions (e.g., a 272,535 kg CO2e reduction through energy-saving measures) but lacks comprehensive financial quantification of climate-related risks or potential future costs.

2. **Alignment with Standards:**
   - While the company adheres to ISO standards for environmental management, the report does not explicitly reference frameworks like the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which could enhance the granularity and comparability of its climate risk disclosures.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Comprehensive risk identification encompassing both physical (extreme weather) and transition (regulatory) risks.
   - Proactive measures, such as renewable energy adoption and robust insurance coverage, reflect a forward-looking approach to climate resilience.
   - Governance structures, such as the crisis management team, ensure organizational focus on climate-related risks.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Financial Quantification:** Disclose the financial impacts of identified climate risks, including potential costs of regulatory compliance and operational disruptions.
   - **Adoption of TCFD Framework:** Align disclosures with TCFD recommendations to improve transparency and stakeholder confidence.
   - **Scenario Analysis:** Incorporate scenario-based analysis to evaluate the potential impacts of different climate change trajectories on the company’s operations and financial performance.

---

### **Conclusion**

The TTET Union Corporation ESG report demonstrates a clear understanding of the financial and operational risks posed by climate change, supported by robust governance and risk management practices.

#### **Policies Promoting Diversity and Equity**

TTET Union Corporation demonstrates a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion through its hiring and workplace policies. The company strictly prohibits discrimination and ensures fairness in its recruitment and talent management processes.

1. **Anti-Discrimination Commitment:**
   - The company adheres to principles of fairness, impartiality, and integrity in its talent acquisition process. It explicitly prohibits discrimination based on race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, marital status, age, nationality, or physical and mental disabilities.
   - A sexual harassment prevention policy is in place, supported by mandatory education and training for all new employees. Additionally, a dedicated hotline is provided for reporting incidents, ensuring prompt and confidential handling.

2. **Alignment with Human Rights Standards:**

This alignment strengthens its commitment to creating an equitable workplace.

---

#### **Gender Representation and Employee Structure**

1. **Workforce Composition:**
   - In 2023, the workforce consisted of 146 employees, with a male-to-female ratio of approximately 68% male and 32% female. The distribution by job category highlights that women primarily occupy administrative roles (38 out of 53 administrative staff) but are underrepresented in technical positions (2 out of 71 technicians) and management (6 out of 22 managers).

2. **Parental and Childcare Support:**
   - TTET Union Corporation offers childcare subsidies for employees with children under six years old, reducing the financial burden of caregiving responsibilities. This policy reflects an understanding of the needs of working parents, particularly women.

---

#### **Training and Development**

The company emphasizes the importance of human rights and anti-discrimination training. In 2023, 100% of new employees and security personnel completed training on topics such as labor rights, anti-discrimination, and freedom of assembly.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - Comprehensive anti-discrimination policies aligned with international standards.
   - Targeted measures such as childcare subsidies and sexual harassment prevention training.
   - Transparent reporting on workforce composition and commitment to gender equity.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Broader Representation:** Female representation in technical and leadership roles remains limited. Initiatives to promote women’s participation in these areas could improve gender equity.
   - **Diversity Metrics:** Enhanced reporting on minority representation and other dimensions of diversity (e.g., LGBTQ+ inclusion, people with disabilities) would strengthen transparency.
   - **Leadership Diversity:** Additional policies to encourage gender and minority inclusion at the executive and managerial levels would align with global best practices in DEI.

---

### **Conclusion**

TTET Union Corporation has implemented robust policies to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, further action is required to enhance representation across all job categories, particularly in technical and managerial roles. Improved transparency through more detailed metrics and targeted initiatives could bolster the company’s commitment to creating an inclusive and equitable workplace.",0.5,0.0769230768639053,0.6537694151963458,1.0,0.44,0.8760066961453544

The company also conducts a **Supplier Social Assessment**, which evaluates the social practices of its suppliers to ensure alignment with TTET Union Corp.'s ethical standards.

Corporation

TTET Union Corporation has established a comprehensive governance structure to oversee its sustainability efforts, which are integral to its corporate strategy. The company does not have a dedicated ESG committee per se; however, its sustainability initiatives are managed through various organizational bodies that play crucial roles in governance and oversight.

### Governance Structure

1. **Board of Directors**: The highest governing body at TTET Union Corporation is the Board of Directors, which is responsible for overseeing the company's operations and strategic direction. This board plays a pivotal role in ensuring that sustainability practices align with corporate governance policies. It conducts regular evaluations of the company's performance, including sustainability initiatives, and oversees the management of climate-related risks and opportunities [Data: Relationships (549, 140, 102)].

2. **Sustainable Development Management Organization**: This organization operates under the umbrella of TTET Union Corporation and is tasked with implementing sustainable development initiatives. It prepares the annual Sustainability Report and reports its findings to the Board of Directors, ensuring that sustainability efforts are effectively monitored and supported at the highest level [Data: Entities (29, 104); Relationships (542, 104)].

3. **Corporate Sustainable Development Management Organization**: This body is specifically focused on assessing climate-related risks and opportunities, further integrating sustainability into the company's governance framework. It formulates strategies to mitigate these risks and reports directly to the Board of Directors [Data: Entities (648); Relationships (690, 437)].

### Integration of Sustainability into Governance

The integration of sustainability into governance structures at TTET Union Corporation is evident through several key practices:

- **Annual Reporting**: The Sustainable Development Management Organization issues an annual Sustainability Report, which details the company's sustainable development efforts and results. This report is reviewed and confirmed by the Board of Directors before publication, ensuring accountability and transparency [Data: Relationships (102, 104)].

- **Compliance with Regulations**: The company adheres to regulations set forth by the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TWSE) regarding sustainability reporting. This compliance ensures that the company meets established standards for transparency and accountability in its sustainability practices [Data: Entities (322); Relationships (108)].

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: TTET Union Corporation actively compiles sustainability issues based on stakeholder opinions, which informs its governance practices and sustainability strategies. This engagement reflects a commitment to addressing the concerns and expectations of various stakeholders [Data: Relationships (593)].

In summary, while TTET Union Corporation may not have a dedicated ESG committee, its governance structure effectively integrates sustainability oversight through the Board of Directors and specialized organizations focused on sustainable development. This multi-faceted approach ensures that sustainability is a core component of the company's strategic direction and operational practices.","### **Analysis of TTET Union Corporation's Governance of Sustainability Efforts**

---

#### **Integration into Governance Structures**

1. **Board-Level Oversight:**
   - The Board of Directors is the highest governing body overseeing sustainability and ethical corporate management. By receiving annual updates from the SDMO, the board ensures that sustainability efforts are aligned with the company’s broader strategic objectives.

2. **Committees Supporting Governance:**
   - In addition to the SDMO, TTET Union Corporation has established specialized committees such as the Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee. These committees enhance governance quality by providing independent oversight and ensuring accountability in financial, ethical, and strategic operations.

3. **Transparency and Accountability:**
   - The company values operational transparency and publishes detailed reports on sustainability initiatives. The availability of English-language versions of corporate governance information and sustainability reports further reflects its commitment to global stakeholder engagement.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

   - Clear delineation of responsibilities within the SDMO ensures comprehensive coverage of key sustainability topics.
   - Annual reporting to the Board of Directors reflects strong governance integration and accountability.
   - Structured committees and policies strengthen oversight mechanisms.

2. **Areas for Improvement:**
   - **Performance Metrics:** While governance structures are robust, reporting on the outcomes of these governance efforts (e.g., specific sustainability achievements) could provide greater transparency.
   - **Broader Stakeholder Representation:** Including stakeholder input directly in board-level discussions could further align sustainability initiatives with external expectations.

Procedures

The sustainability report prepared by TTET Union Corporation includes a comprehensive overview of its anti-corruption policies and procedures. Specifically, the report aligns with the GRI Standards, which emphasize the importance of transparency in reporting anti-corruption measures. The GRI Standard requires organizations to disclose their anti-corruption practices, including any confirmed incidents of corruption and the actions taken in response [Data: GRI STANDARD (829, 1246, 1252); SUSTAINABILITY REPORT (7, 98)].

## Evidence of Implementation

In terms of evidence of implementation, the report does provide insights into confirmed incidents of corruption and the corrective actions taken. This aligns with the GRI Standards, which mandate that organizations report on confirmed incidents of corruption to ensure accountability and transparency [Data: CONFIRMED INCIDENTS OF CORRUPTION (887); GRI STANDARD (1230)]. The inclusion of such information demonstrates TTET Union Corp.'s commitment to addressing corruption and maintaining ethical practices within its operations.

Furthermore, the report outlines the organization's dedication to operational transparency and ethical governance, which are critical components in the fight against corruption. By documenting these incidents and the measures taken, the report serves as a vital tool for stakeholders to assess the effectiveness of the anti-corruption policies in practice [Data: OPERATIONAL TRANSPARENCY (335); CORPORATE INTEGRITY (2)].

## Conclusion

Overall, the sustainability report not only discloses anti-corruption policies and procedures but also provides evidence of their implementation through documented cases and outcomes. This commitment to transparency and accountability is essential for fostering trust among stakeholders and ensuring that the organization adheres to high ethical standards in its operations.","### **Analysis of Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures in TTET Union Corporation**
