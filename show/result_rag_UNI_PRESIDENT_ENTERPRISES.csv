Key frameworks referenced in the report include the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and sustainability accounting standards specific to the food industry, such as those established by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).

The report explicitly states that it is prepared in accordance with the ""Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation Rules Governing the Preparation and Filing of Sustainability Reports by TWSE Listed Companies"" and aligns with the GRI Standards 2021. This adherence to GRI allows the company to provide detailed disclosures regarding its economic performance, environmental impact, and social responsibility, which are essential for stakeholders seeking to understand the company's sustainability practices.

In terms of TCFD alignment, the report addresses various recommended disclosures, including the identification and assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities, the board's oversight of climate issues, and the integration of these risks into the overall risk management framework.

The report not only follows these frameworks but also integrates metrics and targets for managing climate-related risks and opportunities. It includes comprehensive information about greenhouse gas emissions, energy management, and a sustainable value chain, which aligns well with the expectations set forth by GRI and TCFD. Overall, Uni-President's ESG report demonstrates a robust alignment with internationally recognized standards, showcasing its commitment to transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in sustainability practices.","#### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report of Uni-President Enterprises**

#### **Alignment with Frameworks**

1. **Strengths in Alignment:**
   - The report demonstrates strong alignment with the GRI Standards by providing a detailed materiality assessment and linking its initiatives to globally accepted indicators. 
   - The integration of TCFD is a significant strength, as it addresses climate governance, strategy, and risk management comprehensively. Specific actions, such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy usage, illustrate adherence to TCFD recommendations.
   - SASB alignment ensures the report is tailored to the unique challenges of the food industry, addressing topics like food safety, responsible sourcing, and packaging material management.
   - The adherence to ISO standards further validates operational excellence and compliance with international norms.

2. **Opportunities for Improvement:**
   - The report could enhance its presentation of SDG alignment by explicitly mapping initiatives and achievements to relevant UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) beyond a high-level summary.
   - While TCFD disclosures are present, further details on scenario analysis and the financial implications of climate-related risks would strengthen the alignment.
   - Incorporating more granular data for SASB-aligned metrics, such as energy intensity per production unit or detailed breakdowns of food safety incidents, could improve investor-focused transparency.

""]","Yes, the organizational scope and time frame of the report are clearly defined. The report specifies that the main period of the published data is from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023, with some data tracing back to related performances before 2023. 

In terms of organizational scope, the report primarily focuses on Uni-President's businesses in Taiwan, particularly the five general plants located in Yungkang, Xinshih, Taichung, Yangmei, and Chungli, as well as Hukou Park. The document also indicates that the report includes information related to the sustainability performance of the company, considering aspects such as environmental management, food safety, and occupational health and safety, among others. 

While the report provides a detailed account of the company's operations and sustainability efforts, it also notes that some of the Group's publicly listed subsidiaries regularly release their own ESG reports. However, the specific details regarding the inclusion of supply chains or other subsidiaries in the current report are not explicitly mentioned. For the most comprehensive and up-to-date information, readers are encouraged to refer to the company's website.","#### **Organizational Scope and Time Frame of the Report**

The ESG report of Uni-President Enterprises provides a clear definition of the organizational scope and time frame for the disclosed information. This ensures transparency and enables stakeholders to understand the boundaries of the report’s applicability.

1. **Time Frame:**
   - The report covers the fiscal year 2023, with data reflecting performance and initiatives undertaken during this period. Additionally, it includes comparisons with prior years to demonstrate progress or identify trends over time, such as in greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, and water consumption.

2. **Organizational Scope:**
   - The report encompasses Uni-President Enterprises’ operations both domestically and internationally, including its consolidated subsidiaries. It highlights efforts across various business segments such as food manufacturing, distribution, and packaging. For instance, the report mentions sustainability initiatives at specific facilities, such as the Xinshi Logistics Park, which is implementing a solar photovoltaic deployment plan expected to complete by 2024.

3. **Inclusion of Supply Chains:**
   - The report explicitly includes aspects of the company’s supply chain management. It describes efforts to evaluate and guide suppliers on food safety standards and environmental impact, such as conducting audits and risk assessments for 156 suppliers in 2023. The commitment to responsible sourcing is further demonstrated through the procurement of soybeans certified by the Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol (SSAP).

4. **Clarification of Boundaries:**
   - The report delineates its boundaries by focusing on Uni-President’s direct operations and its value chain, including upstream (raw material sourcing) and downstream (product distribution) activities. It also discusses collaboration with stakeholders like government entities, academic institutions, and public interest groups, which indirectly contribute to the company’s sustainability outcomes.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The scope is comprehensive, covering both direct operations and the broader value chain.
   - It explicitly identifies subsidiaries and supply chain activities included in the report, providing transparency to stakeholders.
   - Comparative data across multiple years and inclusion of future targets, such as greenhouse gas reduction goals for 2030, reinforce a forward-looking perspective.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - While the report specifies operational and supply chain boundaries, it could benefit from greater clarity on the extent of reporting for international subsidiaries. For example, more details on how overseas operations contribute to or align with sustainability initiatives would enhance completeness.
   - Specific challenges faced in data collection or limitations in scope (if any) are not explicitly mentioned, which could provide additional context to stakeholders.

---

#### **Conclusion:**

The Uni-President Enterprises ESG report effectively defines its organizational scope and time frame, encompassing both operational and supply chain activities. This comprehensive approach ensures that the report provides a clear picture of the company’s sustainability performance across its various business segments. Opportunities remain to enhance the clarity of disclosures for international operations and potential reporting limitations, thereby further strengthening stakeholder confidence in the company’s ESG transparency.",0.9,0.0,0.8443031919549481,1.0,0.17,0.7819154149675248

Nowadays, it is impossible to ignore the impact of \nclimate change on us. We must take immediate action to maintain the sustainable development of human society and the natural \nenvironment. Businesses play a key role in addressing the challenge of climate change. By reducing carbon emissions and investing in \ngreen technologies, enterprises can fulfill their corporate social responsibilities while reducing the impact of climate change, to \npromote sustainable management practices. In addition to proactively implementing energy conservation and carbon reduction \nmeasures in each factory, we have also adopted the methods recommended in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) since 2020 to strengthen our control mechanism for climate risks, comprehensively assess and review the \nimpact of climate change on the Company, and then formulate short, medium and long-term governance strategies on climate \nchange issues to cope with the impact of climate change. 3.2.1 Climate Risk Governance\n\nIn terms of climate change governance, the Presidents of Uni-President assumes the overall supervision responsibility and \nsupervises the control status of climate change issues by the ESG Committee.

The report emphasizes the significance of sustainable practices not just as a compliance measure, but as a core component of the company's operational ethos and competitive advantage.

One key connection is established through the formation of the ESG Committee, which is chaired by the Presidents and includes senior executives from various functional groups. This committee is tasked with overseeing the implementation of sustainability initiatives and aligning them with corporate governance and operational objectives. Regular reporting to the Board of Directors ensures that sustainability metrics and performance are scrutinized, allowing for informed decision-making that integrates ESG factors into the broader business strategy.

The report articulates several actionable initiatives aimed at enhancing sustainability. For instance, the company has committed to incorporating ESG-related indicators into the performance evaluations of its senior management. This move is designed to hold leaders accountable for sustainability outcomes and to foster a culture where sustainable business practices are prioritized. Furthermore, the identification and management of material sustainability topics—such as food safety, ethical management, and climate change—demonstrate a structured approach to integrating stakeholder concerns into business operations.

In addition, Uni-President's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing energy conservation projects illustrates a clear action plan to address climate-related risks and opportunities. The company has set specific targets, such as reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 1.50% annually and achieving a significant reduction by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. Such targets are not only aligned with global sustainability trends but also serve to enhance operational resilience and competitiveness in a marketplace increasingly focused on sustainability.

Overall, the connections between Uni-President's ESG initiatives and its business strategy appear well-articulated and actionable. The integration of these initiatives into performance evaluations, governance structures, and specific sustainability targets reflects a commitment to embedding sustainable practices into the organization's core operations, thereby promoting long-term value creation for both the company and its stakeholders.","#### **Integration of ESG Initiatives with Business Strategy**

Uni-President Enterprises demonstrates a clear and deliberate alignment between its ESG initiatives and overall business strategy, as outlined in the 2023 ESG report. The report reflects the company’s recognition that sustainability is integral to long-term value creation, both for stakeholders and the organization. Below is an evaluation of how effectively these connections are articulated and actionable.

---

#### **Alignment with Strategic Objectives**

1. **""One Core and Four Gears"" Strategic Framework:**
   - Uni-President’s overarching business strategy, termed ""One Core and Four Gears,"" places brand management at the core of its operations. This strategy is supported by four pillars: manufacturing and R&D, trade and logistics, experience and retail, and alliances and acquisitions. ESG initiatives are seamlessly embedded within these pillars. For instance:
     - **Manufacturing and R&D:** Emphasis on food safety, nutrition, and sustainable packaging supports innovation while aligning with consumer expectations for healthier and environmentally friendly products.
     - **Trade and Logistics:** Efforts to reduce carbon emissions and implement renewable energy in logistics operations, such as the solar photovoltaic deployment at the Xinshi Logistics Park, demonstrate alignment with climate-related goals.

2. **Integration of ESG Metrics into Leadership Performance:**
   - ESG indicators are included in the performance evaluation of senior executives, including the company’s Presidents. This linkage ensures accountability and alignment between ESG objectives and business outcomes, driving actionable progress across all levels of the organization.

---

#### **Actionable Connections**

1. **Sustainability in Operations:**
   - The report highlights tangible actions, such as reducing Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2.14% and Scope 3 emissions by 32,394 metric tons CO2e in 2023. These reductions are directly tied to the company's long-term goal of a 38% reduction in GHG emissions below 2005 levels by 2030. Such measurable targets ensure that sustainability goals are actionable and progress is trackable.

2. **Sustainable Product Innovation:**
   - ESG initiatives are driving innovation in product development. For example, the application of R-PET packaging materials and reductions in plastic use (5.99 metric tons in 2023) align with both consumer preferences and regulatory trends for sustainable consumption. These efforts support the company's market competitiveness and environmental stewardship.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement:**
   - The company’s social responsibility programs, such as scholarships for disadvantaged students and community canteen projects for the elderly, align with the strategic objective of fostering social harmony. Investments totaling NT$15.47 million in social care initiatives are impactful and reflect an actionable commitment to societal well-being.

---

#### **Clarity and Articulation**

1. **Strategic Reporting:**
   - The report clearly articulates how ESG initiatives contribute to business resilience and long-term growth. For instance, climate-related strategies under the TCFD framework are positioned as essential for ensuring supply chain stability and mitigating operational risks due to environmental changes.

2. **Goals and Progress Tracking:**
   - The inclusion of short-, medium-, and long-term ESG goals (e.g., water consumption efficiency, renewable energy adoption) provides clarity on how initiatives align with and support overall business objectives.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - ESG initiatives are deeply integrated into the company’s strategic framework, ensuring alignment across operational and leadership levels.
   - Specific and measurable goals, such as GHG reductions and sustainable packaging adoption, enhance accountability.
   - Clear communication of progress, such as through quantitative data on emissions and waste reduction, demonstrates transparency.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - While the report provides a comprehensive overview of ESG initiatives, more detailed financial quantification of the benefits from these initiatives (e.g., cost savings from energy efficiency) could further illustrate the value-add to the business strategy.
   - Expanded discussion on international operations’ contributions to ESG goals would enhance the global applicability of the strategy.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Uni-President Enterprises effectively links its ESG initiatives to its broader business strategy, with clear articulation and actionable commitments. By embedding sustainability into core operations, product innovation, and leadership accountability, the company showcases a cohesive approach to integrating ESG principles into its pursuit of long-term business success. Opportunities remain to strengthen the quantification of ESG-driven business outcomes and expand the scope of reporting on global operations.",0.8181818181818182,0.0,0.6350455314352388,1.0,0.44,0.8587366983038429

Given this, we \n\nhave set 2021 as the base year. 4.At present, the electricity emission factor announced by the Bureau of Energy of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is applied to purchased electricity.The electricity emission \nfactor in 2023, which was 0.495 kg CO2e/kWh, was used as the calculation parameter. Other emission parameters are mostly adopted from the \""Greenhouse Gas Emission \nFactor Management Table 6.0.4\"" announced by the Environmental Protection Administration in June 2019, and the applicable factors announced by the IPCC. Since the \nglobal warming potential (GWP) of various greenhouse gases have different impacts on the climate, the calculated emissions of various greenhouse gases from all emission \nsources are multiplied by the GWP value to convert into carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e). The GWP value is currently based on the 2021 IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, and \nmight be changed in accordance with the regulations of government agencies in the future. 5.We began to make inventories on Scope 3 GHG emissions since 2021 and the emission coefficients took reference from EPA's Product Carbon Footprint Information website, \nbusiness database coefficients, academic papers, and similar goods or services of the public carbon footprint data.At present, our inventory items cover items that generate \nGHG emissions upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, employee commuting, business trips, purchased goods, disposal of solid and liquid waste, \ndownstream leasing assets and investments.

In 2023, the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were reported at 1,567,139 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e). This total includes emissions categorized under Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. Specifically, Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions from the company's operations) amounted to 64,903 metric tons CO2e, while Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions from purchased electricity and energy) were recorded at 104,018 metric tons CO2e. The majority of emissions, categorized under Scope 3 (indirect emissions throughout the value chain), reached 1,398,218 metric tons CO2e, accounting for 89% of total emissions.

The report also indicates that these metrics are verified by third parties. In particular, the company engaged SGS Taiwan Ltd. to conduct verification in accordance with ISO 14064-3 standards. The verification provided reasonable assurance for Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, while for Scope 3, the assurance was limited. This external verification process underscores the company's commitment to transparency and accuracy in reporting its environmental impact. 

Furthermore, the report outlines the methodologies used for GHG inventory management, demonstrating adherence to international standards such as ISO 14064-1:2018 and details about the emission factors utilized for calculations. This structured approach, along with third-party verification, enhances the credibility of the reported data.","#### **Carbon Emissions Data and Verification in the ESG Report**

In 2023, the total GHG emissions was \n1,567,139 metric tons of CO2e, and among this, the GHG emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 (self-operations) were 168,921 metric \ntons of CO2e (account for 11% of the total emissions), while the GHG emissions for Scope 3 (value chain) were 1,398,218 metric \ntons of CO2e (accounting for 89% of total emissions). Of all the GHG emissions from self-operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2), 100,621 metric tons of CO2e were the main emission \nsource generated by purchased electricity, accounting for 60% of the GHG emissions from self-operations; followed by fixed \nemissions, including emissions generated from the use of fuel for power generation engines, boilers, and heaters, with emissions \nof 52,196 metric tons of CO2e, accounting for 31% of the GHG emissions from self-operations. The GHG emissions in the value chain this year covered upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, employee \ncommuting, business travel, purchased goods, disposal of solid and liquid waste, downstream leasing assets and investments. Among these items, purchased goods were the main source of emissions with 980,159 metric tons of CO2e,accounting for 70% of \nGHG emissions in the value chain; followed by emissions generated due to investments, with a total of emissions of 288,498 metric \ntons of CO2e, accounting for 21% of GHG emissions in the value chain. In 2023, the self-operating (Scope 1 and Scope 2) GHG emission intensity was 34.76 metric tons of CO2e/per NT$10 million \nof sales revenue. The greenhouse gas emission intensity of the value chain (scope 3) for this year is 287.76 metric tons of CO2e per \nNT$10 million of sales revenue. Going forward, we will keep an eye on and control the emission intensity, aspiring to eventually \naccomplish the aim of decoupling business growth from carbon emissions.

By taking this approach, not only have we expanded the inventory scope, \nthe internal GHG promotional team was also adjusted. Furthermore, through comprehensive inventory process and stringent \nexternal verification mechanisms, the management for direct and indirect GHG emissions is strengthened and the carbon \nmanagement of Uni-President moves towards a new milestone. In addition, we have an Energy Management Team in place to set management targets for each plant and to evaluate \nenergy management incentives in groups.""]","The emission reduction targets outlined in the report from Uni-President Enterprises do have a structured approach that aligns with science-based criteria, although specific science-based validation is not explicitly mentioned in the provided data. The company's strategy includes a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 1.50% annually, with an overarching goal of achieving a 38% reduction by the year 2030 compared to a 2005 baseline.

Water was withdrawn from various sources, with 11.45% from surface water, 3.09% from groundwater, and \n85.46% from tap water. The total water discharge in 2023 amounted to 3,175 million liters, of which 3.86% was handed over to \na third party for treatment, and the remaining 96.14% was discharged from the drains of each plant (surface water). The water \nwithdrawal of Yungkang and Xinshih General Plants, which are located in the higher water source risk area, account for 49.97% of \nthe total water withdrawal and 50.49% of the total water discharge. The water withdrawal intensity in 2023 decreased by 1.11% \ncompared to 2022, reaching the 2023 target. In the future, we plan to continue to optimize water consumption efficiency with a \nwater withdrawal intensity of less than 1.00 million liters/NT$ 10 million (sales revenue).For relevant data, see Appendix I Use of \nWater Resources for the Past Three Years.

Specific action plans\n\n1. Continuously strive to reduce carbon emissions by means such as increasing the installation of solar photovoltaic systems, \nenhancing energy usage, introducing high-efficiency energy-saving equipment, and purchasing green electricity. In 2024, an \ninvestment of NT$85 million was made to set up a solar power generation facility in the Xinshih Logistics Park, with an expected \nannual electricity generation of 2,561 kWh, reducing carbon emissions by 1,304 metric tons of CO2e."", ""page|source|page_content\n52|./esg_report/UNI_PRESIDENT_ENTERPRISES.pdf|In the future, we will continue to pay attention to the emission concentrations of \nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). 3.4.2 Waste Management and Circular Economy \n (GRI 306)\n\nAt Uni-President, we manage waste from the perspective of the value chain as a whole. In terms of upstream value chain,we \nensure proper treatment of waste by upstream suppliers through a supplier management system, while monitoring the waste \nflow of our OEMs. For our operating activities, we have established the \""Waste Management Measures\"" to ensure that not only \nis all waste properly classified and managed, but waste must also be removed and treated in accordance with procedures and \nregulations. All waste generated in the process of our operation is disposed of by an outsourced vendor. Waste includes:general \nwaste, food material waste, sludge, recycled packaging materials, and hazardous waste.The total amount of waste generated in \n2023 was 40,959 metric tons, an increase of 12.5% compared to 2022. The increase in waste generation was mainly due to the \nincrease in the production of soy milk and tea products by Xinshih General Plant and Yangmei General Plant according to market \ndemand. The amount of bean dregs and tea residues increased by 2,602 metric tons and 616 metric tons compared to 2022, \nrespectively. For the waste generation and disposal status in the past three years, please refer to Appendix I ESG Information. Although  the  amount  of  waste  can  be  reduced  by  relying  on  the  improvement  of  manufacturing  processes  or  other \ntechnologies, with the increase of the Company's business, the key to controlling the amount of waste is to effectively increase the \nwaste recycling rate. We actively adopt the circular economy mindset and set KPIs for waste reuse management. Since 2016, we \nhave achieved our waste management targets for seven consecutive years, with a waste recycling rate of 95.64% this year. Specific \ncircular economy cases are explained below:\n\nSoybean residue reuse\nUni-President is the first company in Taiwan to have obtained the certification of soybean as a byproduct in \nthe manufacturing process by the Council of Agriculture. Not only this, but we were the first company in Taiwan to \nuse soybean residue as a resource. Soybean residue generated in Xinshih General Plant is converted into feed for \ndairy cattle, saving waste removal costs while also bringing us new economic benefits. In 2023, we reused as many \nas 6,882 metric tons of bean dregs, an increase of approximately 4 times compared to 2022. Decrease in moisture content of sludge \nand recycling of sludge\n\nWe composted the sludge at Yangmei General Plant, Chungli \nGeneral Plant and Hukou Park, but in 2023, they were transferred \nto Yuen Foong Yu for biomass energy treatment.

For waste that may be reused for food, we have clear regulations in \nplace that prohibits its use in food reprocessing or to be used as food to ensure food safety. In addition, in order to strengthen \nthe flow tracking of waste, we use a GPS system to clearly track and inspect the flow of waste, resources, and hazardous waste \ngenerated by each plant. The inspection includes treatment of waste and resources, waste storage approaches, disposal records, \nflow, and transportation licenses. In 2023, a total of 23 waste, resources, and hazardous waste treatment companies were \ninspected, with a total of 81 tracked.

In 2023, the total GHG emissions was \n1,567,139 metric tons of CO2e, and among this, the GHG emissions for Scope 1 and Scope 2 (self-operations) were 168,921 metric \ntons of CO2e (account for 11% of the total emissions), while the GHG emissions for Scope 3 (value chain) were 1,398,218 metric \ntons of CO2e (accounting for 89% of total emissions). Of all the GHG emissions from self-operations (Scope 1 and Scope 2), 100,621 metric tons of CO2e were the main emission \nsource generated by purchased electricity, accounting for 60% of the GHG emissions from self-operations; followed by fixed \nemissions, including emissions generated from the use of fuel for power generation engines, boilers, and heaters, with emissions \nof 52,196 metric tons of CO2e, accounting for 31% of the GHG emissions from self-operations. The GHG emissions in the value chain this year covered upstream and downstream transportation and distribution, employee \ncommuting, business travel, purchased goods, disposal of solid and liquid waste, downstream leasing assets and investments. Among these items, purchased goods were the main source of emissions with 980,159 metric tons of CO2e,accounting for 70% of \nGHG emissions in the value chain; followed by emissions generated due to investments, with a total of emissions of 288,498 metric \ntons of CO2e, accounting for 21% of GHG emissions in the value chain. In 2023, the self-operating (Scope 1 and Scope 2) GHG emission intensity was 34.76 metric tons of CO2e/per NT$10 million \nof sales revenue. The greenhouse gas emission intensity of the value chain (scope 3) for this year is 287.76 metric tons of CO2e per \nNT$10 million of sales revenue.

The company recognizes the importance of managing waste throughout its value chain and has established specific measures to address waste generation and disposal.

In terms of waste reduction, Uni-President has implemented a ""Waste Management Measures"" framework that ensures all waste is properly classified and managed according to regulations. This framework includes monitoring waste flows from upstream suppliers and operating activities, as well as employing an outsourced vendor for waste disposal. The report specifies that the total amount of waste generated in 2023 was 40,959 metric tons, which reflects a 12.5% increase compared to the previous year due to higher production levels. However, despite this increase, the company remains committed to improving waste recycling rates.

The circular economy initiatives are reflected in their impressive waste recycling rate of 95.64% achieved in 2023. This is part of their broader strategy to adopt a circular economy mindset, which sets key performance indicators (KPIs) for waste reuse management. For example, Uni-President has successfully repurposed soybean residue into animal feed, significantly increasing the volume reused compared to previous years. The report notes that in 2023, they reused 6,882 metric tons of soybean residue, up from previous amounts, contributing to both waste reduction and economic benefits.

Measurable results of these strategies are disclosed in the report, which includes detailed statistics on waste generation, the types of waste recycled, and the recycling rates achieved over the years. These metrics demonstrate Uni-President's commitment to effective waste management and highlight the tangible outcomes of their initiatives, allowing stakeholders to assess the company's environmental performance comprehensively. The transparency in reporting these figures underscores their accountability and dedication to sustainability.","#### **Waste Management Strategies in the ESG Report**

This approach is designed to identify, evaluate, and manage the implications of climate-related risks and opportunities across different timeframes—short, medium, and long-term.

In terms of identifying and assessing these climate risks, the company employs a systematic three-stage process. This process encompasses collecting data on climate-related risks, inventorying these risks, and confirming key risks and opportunities. For instance, the company has identified specific physical risks such as the increased severity of extreme weather events—including typhoons, floods, and droughts—which may disrupt their supply chain, damage equipment, and increase operational costs. They also recognize transformation risks associated with evolving regulatory requirements and societal expectations regarding sustainability, such as new product labeling regulations and carbon management costs.

To quantify the financial impact of these risks, Uni-President has further refined its assessment strategies, allowing them to adjust their management responses accordingly. The company reports that increasing regulatory pressure, such as Taiwan's Climate Change Response Act—which mandates carbon fees—will likely result in higher production costs. The anticipated financial implications include not only increased operational costs due to compliance but also the potential for fines if regulations are not met. 

The governance of climate risks is overseen by the Board of Directors and the ESG Committee, which ensures that climate-related issues are integrated into the overall risk management framework of the organization. The ESG Committee conducts annual reviews of sustainability performance, including the implementation status of risk management policies, and reports findings to the Board. This governance structure enables the company to remain responsive to both current and emerging climate-related challenges.

In summary, Uni-President Enterprises addresses climate change risks through a structured assessment process, quantifying potential financial impacts and integrating these insights into their broader risk management strategy. By doing so, they aim to mitigate risks while enhancing their operational resilience and aligning with regulatory frameworks and societal expectations.","#### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate Change Risks**

The ESG report of Uni-President Enterprises demonstrates a comprehensive approach to assessing and disclosing the financial and operational risks posed by climate change. This includes detailed consideration of the impacts of extreme weather events, regulatory changes, and the broader transition to a low-carbon economy.

---

#### **Assessment of Climate-Related Risks**

1. **Integration with TCFD Framework:**
   - The company aligns with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework to systematically evaluate climate risks. This ensures that governance, strategy, and risk management processes address climate change comprehensively.

2. **Physical Risks:**
   - The report identifies potential risks associated with extreme weather events, such as floods or droughts, which could disrupt production or supply chain stability. For example, climate variability impacting raw material supply, such as soybeans, is explicitly acknowledged, and mitigation measures, such as adjusting production parameters, are described.

3. **Transition Risks:**
   - Regulatory risks, such as evolving government policies on emissions reductions and renewable energy, are assessed as part of the company’s risk management framework. Uni-President proactively addresses these by aligning its operations with regulatory requirements and adopting low-carbon strategies.

---

#### **Disclosures on Financial and Operational Impacts**

1. **Financial Risks:**
   - While the report does not quantify specific financial losses related to climate risks, it highlights measures to minimize financial exposure. For example, the adoption of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvements directly mitigate the financial impact of rising energy costs due to regulatory pressures.

2. **Operational Risks:**
   - The report discusses measures to improve resilience against operational disruptions caused by climate events. Initiatives like renewable energy adoption, real-time monitoring of environmental conditions, and optimizing water and energy use reflect the company’s preparedness for potential disruptions.

---

#### **Proactive Mitigation Strategies**

1. **Renewable Energy Deployment:**
   - The solar photovoltaic deployment at Xinshi Logistics Park and the use of biogas highlight efforts to reduce dependency on fossil fuels, thus mitigating risks associated with carbon pricing and energy volatility.

2. **Greenhouse Gas Reduction Targets:**
   - By setting and achieving annual and long-term GHG emission reduction targets (e.g., a 2.14% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity in 2023), the company reduces its regulatory and reputational risks.

3. **Sustainable Supply Chain Management:**
   - The company’s efforts to manage supply chain stability, including supplier audits and the procurement of certified sustainable materials, mitigate risks arising from resource scarcity and market volatility.

---

#### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

1. **Strengths:**
   - The adoption of the TCFD framework ensures a structured and comprehensive approach to assessing and managing climate-related risks.
   - Clear identification of physical and transition risks, with proactive measures to address these challenges, reflects a forward-looking strategy.
   - Alignment with measurable targets, such as renewable energy adoption and emissions reductions, demonstrates actionable commitment to mitigating climate risks.

2. **Improvement Areas:**
   - The report could include more explicit financial quantification of climate risks, such as potential cost savings from mitigation measures or financial impacts of extreme weather events.
   - A more detailed discussion on scenario analysis, such as stress-testing operations under different climate scenarios, would enhance stakeholder understanding of long-term resilience.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Uni-President Enterprises effectively assesses and discloses the financial and operational risks posed by climate change, leveraging frameworks like TCFD to structure its approach. While the report outlines a clear strategy and measurable mitigation efforts, greater transparency in financial quantification and scenario analysis would further strengthen its climate resilience narrative. These enhancements would provide stakeholders with deeper insights into the company’s preparedness for a rapidly changing environmental and regulatory landscape.",0.875,0.0,0.7445382743692551,1.0,0.62,0.8645317818620136

A primary focus is placed on preventing child labor and forced/compulsory labor, ensuring freedom of association, non-discrimination, and maintaining a safe, hygienic, and healthy work environment. The company has established rules and regulations that address human rights-related issues, including anti-discrimination policies and bullying prevention. These policies are incorporated into the training programs for new employees, ensuring that such topics are well understood from the outset. In 2023, training sessions on sexual harassment prevention, occupational safety regulations, gender equality, and maternal health protection were conducted, encompassing 2,149 trainees and totaling 3,380 training hours.

Furthermore, Uni-President emphasizes the importance of compliance across its supply chain. The company includes human rights standards in contracts with suppliers, explicitly prohibiting child labor and forced labor while guaranteeing employees' freedom of assembly and association. Regular on-site audits are conducted to ensure that suppliers adhere to these standards and implement appropriate human rights protections effectively.

To bolster its commitment to ethical labor practices, the report details a comprehensive auditing process related to compliance checks. In 2023, the company conducted 13 audits focusing on various themes, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery policies, compliance with charitable donation regulations, and avoidance of conflicts of interest. Notably, these audits found no abnormalities related to integrity management, demonstrating the effectiveness of the company's oversight mechanisms. Additionally, all suppliers engaged with Uni-President signed a Letter of Commitment to prohibit bribery, achieving a 100% signing rate, which underscores the company’s stringent approach to ensuring ethical practices throughout its supply chain.

The report mentions that the organization promotes overall employee development through courses focused on aesthetic taste and physical and mental growth, which, while primarily aimed at employees, indirectly benefits the community by fostering a more skilled and engaged workforce.

Regarding community engagement, the report highlights initiatives related to local community impact assessments and development programs. These programs typically encompass efforts in areas such as healthcare, preventive medicine, and social care for disadvantaged groups. The company appears to be committed to engaging with local communities and assessing the impacts of its operational activities, suggesting a structured approach to community contribution.

However, specific measurable impacts of these initiatives are not explicitly detailed in the excerpts provided. The report outlines the framework for assessing sustainability topics and stakeholder feedback but does not provide quantitative metrics or case studies that demonstrate the direct outcomes of community development initiatives in education, healthcare, or infrastructure. It indicates a focus on stakeholder engagement and the implementation of sustainability practices, yet further data would be necessary to understand the full scope and effectiveness of these contributions. 

In summary, while Uni-President Enterprises acknowledges its efforts in community development and outlines its framework for sustainability, it lacks detailed measurable impacts in the information provided. More comprehensive data would be required to evaluate the effectiveness and reach of these initiatives fully.","#### **Contributions to Community Development**

The training \ncontent covers business unit experience and production unit experience, and provides new partners with a deeper understanding \nof the Company's grassroots operations.

The joint training plan is designed based on current work, \nincluding internships at related companies, key functional training, brand marketing and business sales professional ability \ndevelopment, etc. to cultivate cross-disciplinary thinking and deepen various basic capabilities of operation and management \nthrough learning by doing. Review mechanisms and opinion exchange activities are used to complement the learning process, \nencouraging individuals to learn from each other and from themselves, thus allowing for the creation of more comprehensive \nand individualized talent development plans. At the same time, the 10-20-70 principle is adopted, where 10% comes from formal \ntraining and education, 20% comes from interaction and feedback between supervisors and others, and 70% of learning comes \nfrom practical work training. Through a more flexible training model, combined with the common training goals and job task \nrequirements of the Group's business partners, we extend learning from classrooms to practical tasks, strengthen the correlation \nbetween training and work, and continue to cultivate potential talent pools at all levels of the Company and managerial elites at \nhome and abroad. As a means of reinforcing talent cultivation, we continue to improve our systemic learning mechanism, while introducing \nnew forms of learning tools and diversified virtual/real integrated learning types. Our employees are encouraged to improve \ntheir autonomous learning so that they are able to strengthen work capabilities and momentum at all times in order to increase \ncompetitiveness. The Company initiated home/remote offices. With this, we enhanced IT hardware and software as well as \nimplementing electronic operating procedures. These approaches have enabled employees to simulate remote operations and \nteam backup to ensure uninterrupted operations. In addition, we have also developed relevant training regulations for employees at all levels. The minimum annual training \nhours for senior level managers are 36 hours, for mid-level managers 30 hours, and for base level managers 24 hours.

To enhance the learning experience, Uni-President employs the ""10-20-70 principle,"" where 10% of learning comes from formal education, 20% from interactions and feedback, and 70% from practical work experience. This approach fosters a more integrated learning environment by extending training from classrooms to real-world applications, thereby strengthening the correlation between training and work responsibilities. Additionally, employees are encouraged to engage in self-initiative courses that promote personal growth and creativity.

In terms of statistics, the training compliance rates for different managerial levels in 2023 were notably high: 94.6% for senior managers, 96.0% for mid-level managers, and 97.2% for base level managers. These figures suggest a strong commitment among employees to participate in the training programs. Furthermore, the company has set minimum annual training hour requirements—36 hours for senior managers, 30 hours for mid-level managers, and 24 hours for base level managers—to ensure consistent employee development. 

While the document does not provide specific success stories, the structured training programs and high compliance rates indicate that the company is making significant strides in cultivating a skilled workforce that is well-prepared to meet the operational demands of the business. The continuous improvement of the learning mechanisms, including the introduction of new learning tools and formats, further supports the aim of enhancing employee capabilities and competitiveness.","#### **Employee Training and Career Development**

Uni-President Enterprises has implemented a comprehensive training and career development program to enhance employee skills, foster professional growth, and support the company’s long-term sustainability objectives. These initiatives are outlined in detail in its ESG report and supported by metrics that demonstrate their impact.
