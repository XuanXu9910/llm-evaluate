[Data: Relationships (3314, 3315)]""]","The company employs several strategies to assess and disclose the financial and operational risks posed by climate change, including extreme weather events and regulatory changes. A key framework utilized in this process is the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which helps organizations systematically identify and communicate climate-related financial risks and opportunities. By adopting the TCFD framework, the company can enhance transparency in its financial reporting regarding climate issues, thereby improving stakeholder understanding and decision-making related to climate risk management.

In addition to using the TCFD framework, the company actively engages in scenario analysis as part of its climate risk management efforts. This method allows the organization to evaluate its resilience to various climate-related risks by considering different assumptions and potential future scenarios. Through this analysis, the company can better prepare for potential impacts from climate change, including the effects of extreme weather events and shifting regulatory landscapes.

The company's governance structure plays a critical role in overseeing these assessments. The ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Committee is responsible for integrating climate-related strategies into the overall governance framework, ensuring accountability and transparency. Regular surveys conducted by the ESG Committee further facilitate the assessment of stakeholder concerns regarding climate risks, gathering insights that inform decision-making and strategy development.

Operationally, the company focuses on monitoring specific climate risks, such as flood inundation and high temperatures, particularly at vulnerable facilities like its Linyuan Plant. By implementing countermeasures and collaborating with disaster reduction centers, the company seeks to mitigate the impacts of these risks, thus ensuring operational continuity. Moreover, the integration of climate risk considerations into the risk management system underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and proactive responses to climate-related challenges.
