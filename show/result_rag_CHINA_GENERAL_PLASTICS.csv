Specifically, the report follows the 2021 edition of the GRI Universal Standards, which provides a comprehensive framework for sustainability reporting that aims to enhance transparency and accountability in corporate practices related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues.

The GRI framework emphasizes a dual materiality approach, where CGPC identifies material topics based on their impact on the company and the effects of the company's operations on the economy, environment, and society. This process involves a systematic identification and analysis of stakeholder concerns, with results being validated by the ESG Committee and subsequently reported to the Board of Directors for approval. This ensures that the report reflects both internal and external stakeholder interests, aligning well with GRI's principles of stakeholder inclusiveness and sustainability context.

In addition to GRI, CGPC also adopts the SASB standards, particularly focusing on industry-specific issues pertinent to the chemicals sector. This integration enables the company to assess and report on environmental impacts, such as greenhouse gas emissions, water management, and waste management, in a manner that resonates with investor interests and industry benchmarks. 

The report also aligns with the TCFD framework, which is pivotal in managing climate-related risks and opportunities. CGPC employs the TCFD structure to identify and assess potential climate-related risks across its operations, facilitating the development of response strategies and enhancing the company's resilience against climate change. The ESG Committee oversees this process, ensuring that climate governance is integrated into the corporate strategy.

Overall, CGPC's ESG report demonstrates a strong alignment with these internationally recognized frameworks, reflecting a commitment to transparency and responsible management of ESG issues. By adhering to GRI, SASB, and TCFD, the company not only complies with global standards but also enhances its credibility and accountability to stakeholders, contributing to sustainable development goals and fostering trust in its operations.","### **Frameworks Followed in the ESG Report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC)**

The company has established three primary strategies: research and development (R&D) and innovation, stable operations, and social inclusion, which are designed to align with its sustainability vision. These strategies are not only foundational to the company's operational goals but also respond to the expectations of stakeholders, including employees, customers, and government agencies.

The report articulates the connection between ESG initiatives and business strategy through a structured process of materiality analysis. This analysis is conducted every two years and incorporates a dual materiality approach, assessing both the impact of ESG issues on the company’s performance and the broader implications for the economy, environment, and society. The identification of significant ESG issues is reported to the Board of Directors after thorough evaluation by the ESG Committee, ensuring that the initiatives are not only recognized but also actionable. The company has selected twelve major ESG issues that directly inform its strategic decisions, demonstrating a commitment to integrating sustainability into its business model.

Furthermore, the report highlights specific targets and goals related to energy management, waste reduction, and talent development, which serve as actionable items within the broader ESG framework. For instance, the company aims for a 27% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, with a long-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. This level of specificity indicates that the connections between ESG initiatives and business strategy are not only articulated but also embedded in measurable objectives, making them actionable.

In conclusion, the report effectively links the company’s ESG initiatives to its overall business strategy through clearly defined goals, a structured materiality assessment process, and direct involvement of governance bodies in overseeing these strategies. This integration not only illustrates the company’s commitment to sustainability but also positions it to adapt and thrive in an evolving business landscape, thereby reinforcing its competitive advantage.","### **Integration of ESG Initiatives with Business Strategy in the CGPC ESG Report**

Instead, the report outlines various aspects of the company's ESG efforts and achievements, such as the implementation of sustainable management policies, the establishment of performance targets, and the engagement with stakeholders.

While the report mentions that performance evaluations occur annually and that a materiality analysis is performed every two years, it focuses more on the frameworks and strategies in place rather than directly comparing specific ESG metrics over time. For instance, the document discusses the identification and analysis of significant ESG issues, describing ongoing assessments of stakeholder concerns and the establishment of sustainability goals aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

The report's approach to transparency is notable in its thorough detailing of processes for stakeholder engagement, governance structures, and the methodologies used for identifying material issues. However, without explicit historical data comparisons, it may be challenging for readers to gauge the meaningfulness of progress or trends in ESG performance over time. The absence of such comparative metrics can limit the ability to assess the effectiveness of past initiatives relative to current performance, which is a critical aspect of effective ESG reporting.

In summary, while the report outlines CGPC's ESG strategies and stakeholder engagement efforts, it lacks direct comparisons of current performance data with historical data, which would enhance transparency and provide clearer insights into progress and trends over time.","### **Comparison of Current and Historical ESG Performance Data in the CGPC ESG Report**

The ESG report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC) provides meaningful and transparent comparisons of current ESG performance data with historical data, showcasing progress and trends over time. This approach not only demonstrates accountability but also highlights the company’s commitment to continuous improvement in sustainability performance.

---

### **Environmental Performance Trends**

1. **Carbon Emissions and Energy Efficiency:**
   - The report details CGPC’s progress in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, specifically noting carbon reduction achievements. For instance, it references a significant milestone of reducing 9,970 tons of CO2 equivalent in 2023. These reductions are contextualized within CGPC’s long-term carbon neutrality goal for 2050 and its intermediate goal of a 27% reduction by 2030.
   - Historical data are also presented to emphasize progress in renewable energy adoption. CGPC increased its installed solar energy capacity from 2.12MW in previous years to a planned target of 20MW by 2027, indicating a proactive trajectory in energy transformation.

2. **Water Resource Management:**
   - CGPC tracks water recycling rates over time, showcasing improvement. For example, the report cites a year-on-year increase in recycled water consumption, reaching 1,314.1 million liters in 2023, which equates to saving 526 Olympic-sized swimming pools worth of water. These figures provide clear evidence of the company’s focus on water conservation and reuse efficiency.

3. **Waste Management:**
   - Waste reduction and recycling trends are highlighted, with specific metrics showing a steady increase in recycling rates year over year. The report identifies a target of achieving a 90% recycling rate by 2030, compared to the 80% baseline in earlier years.

---

### **Social Performance Comparisons**

1. **Employee Training and Development:**
   - The report offers historical data on employee training hours, noting an increase in the average annual training hours per person, which reached 25.2 hours in 2023. This upward trend underscores CGPC’s commitment to fostering talent development and cultivating a skilled workforce.

2. **Community Engagement:**
   - Historical metrics on volunteer participation and community initiatives provide a lens into CGPC’s social impact. For example, the report mentions 820 participants in social charity activities in 2023, compared to fewer participants in prior years, indicating enhanced engagement efforts.

3. **Contractor Safety Training:**
   - The company reports a consistent increase in safety education, with 4,343 contractor employees receiving safety training in 2023. These metrics highlight CGPC’s dedication to improving workplace safety across its operations and supply chain.

---

### **Governance Performance Trends**

1. **Corporate Governance Evaluations:**
   - CGPC has consistently ranked among the top 6–20% in Taiwan Stock Exchange’s Corporate Governance Evaluations over multiple years. This consistency underscores the company’s strong governance framework and dedication to transparency.

2. **ESG in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
   - The inclusion of ESG metrics in employee KPIs has been progressively integrated. The report reflects how this approach has enhanced accountability and alignment with corporate sustainability objectives over time.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
- **Meaningful Historical Comparisons:** The report effectively uses historical data to illustrate trends and progress in key areas such as carbon reduction, water management, and employee development.
- **Transparency in Metrics:** Quantifiable and year-over-year data provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of CGPC’s trajectory and achievements.
- **Future-Oriented Targets:** The inclusion of specific long-term goals, such as achieving a 90% recycling rate by 2030, provides a forward-looking perspective that builds confidence in CGPC’s sustainability strategy.

**Improvement Areas:**
- **Granularity in Data:** While trends are evident, breaking down progress into more detailed annual intervals could offer a clearer picture of incremental improvements.
- **Comparisons Against Industry Benchmarks:** Including data that benchmarks CGPC’s performance against industry averages would provide additional context for evaluating the company’s relative progress.

---

### **Conclusion**

The CGPC ESG report successfully compares current performance with historical data, offering a transparent and meaningful analysis of progress over time. By presenting clear metrics and trends in environmental, social, and governance domains, the report demonstrates accountability and continuous improvement. Enhanced granularity and benchmarking could further strengthen the value of these comparisons, but overall, the report effectively communicates CGPC’s sustainability journey.",0.6470588235294118,0.124999999921875,0.0,1.0,0.28,0.8524410515567701

The company has established a target to reduce carbon emissions by 27% by the year 2030, using 2017 as a baseline year. Additionally, CGPC has set a long-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. These targets are consistent with the broader goals of the international climate agreements aimed at limiting global warming and reflect a strategic commitment to sustainability.

In terms of tracking progress, the report indicates that CGPC actively monitors and reports on its greenhouse gas emissions, including Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. The company conducts regular reviews of its emission data and performance against these targets, which establishes a clear framework for accountability. The commitment to a comprehensive greenhouse gas inventory and verification process, coupled with the planned introduction of an internal carbon pricing system in 2024, further enhances their ability to track progress effectively.

Milestones, such as the 2030 target for the reduction of emissions, provide clear deadlines for measuring progress. Furthermore, the report outlines specific achievements in emissions reductions, with a noted decrease of 22.2% in greenhouse gas emissions as of the end of 2023 compared to the baseline year. This proactive approach demonstrates CGPC's commitment to not only setting ambitious goals but also to monitoring progress towards achieving them. Overall, the outlined emission reduction targets in the report can be considered science-based, with structured milestones and deadlines for effective tracking.","### **Evaluation of Emission Reduction Targets in the CGPC ESG Report**

The ESG report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC) outlines clear and measurable emission reduction targets. While the targets are ambitious and supported by detailed action plans, their explicit alignment with a science-based framework (e.g., the Science Based Targets initiative, SBTi) is not mentioned in the report. Nonetheless, the inclusion of milestones and deadlines indicates a structured approach to tracking progress effectively.

For the year 2023, CGPC reported a total energy consumption of 3,988,900 GJ. A significant portion of this energy consumption is derived from purchased electricity, which accounted for 25.72% of the total. However, it is noteworthy that the utilization rate of renewable energy was reported as 0%, and there was no self-generated or self-used energy recorded for the year.

In terms of progress over previous years, the report includes data on energy consumption for the past three years, indicating a trend in energy usage. For instance, the total energy consumption in 2021 was 4,309,405 GJ, which decreased to 4,055,542 GJ in 2022, before further reducing to the reported 3,988,900 GJ in 2023. This shows a consistent decline in total energy consumption over the three-year period. 

Additionally, CGPC has set energy management goals under its carbon reduction strategy, aiming for a 27% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, with a long-term target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The company emphasizes the importance of energy efficiency improvements and the promotion of renewable energy, although it has yet to report any utilization of renewable energy sources in its energy mix. The document also highlights energy conservation performance, stating that the company has exceeded its energy-saving target for 2023, achieving a reduction of 1.53%. 

Overall, while CGPC has made strides in energy efficiency and management, the lack of renewable energy utilization remains a significant area for potential improvement going forward.","### **Analysis of Energy Usage and Efficiency in the CGPC ESG Report**

This process is structured around the guidelines provided by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which aids in systematically identifying and evaluating climate-related risks and opportunities.

To start, the company conducts a risk assessment through a questionnaire survey, involving the ESG Committee and senior executives who evaluate the relevance of various risks to the company’s operations. In 2023, this led to the identification of 12 material climate issues, categorized into physical risks, transition risks, and opportunities. This identification process is part of a broader risk management framework that integrates climate risk assessment into the company’s overall risk management system. The ESG Committee plays a crucial role in overseeing this process, ensuring that all identified risks are regularly assessed and that appropriate management strategies are implemented.

Operationally, the company categorizes climate-related risks into three timeframes: short-term (less than 3 years), medium-term (3 to 7 years), and long-term (more than 7 years). This classification helps in understanding the potential impacts of climate change on the company's operations and financial performance over different time horizons. For example, risks such as floods and droughts are assessed for their potential to disrupt operations and increase costs, while regulatory risks related to carbon fees and government regulations are evaluated for their impact on operational expenses and compliance requirements.

Financially, the company analyzes the potential impacts of these risks on its revenue and expenditures. For instance, increased costs associated with carbon fees and water usage fees are anticipated, and measures are taken to mitigate these through investments in renewable energy and improved efficiency in production processes. The results of these assessments are disclosed in the company’s annual sustainability report, which includes detailed information on greenhouse gas emissions, risk management strategies, and the financial implications of identified risks.

In summary, the company's approach to assessing and disclosing climate-related risks is characterized by a systematic, multi-faceted evaluation process that incorporates stakeholder input, ongoing risk management, and alignment with international standards. This framework not only supports compliance with regulatory requirements but also enhances the company's resilience against climate-related challenges.","### **Assessment and Disclosure of Climate-Related Risks in the CGPC ESG Report**

These efforts are articulated through their human rights management framework, which emphasizes fair and dignified treatment of all employees. The company adheres to international human rights standards, such as the International Bill of Rights and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, to guide their DEI initiatives.

One of the significant aspects of the company's DEI policy is the commitment to prevent discrimination based on various factors, including race, gender, age, and disability. The company explicitly states that employment practices—such as hiring, compensation, training, and promotions—are conducted without unfair treatment or discrimination. This commitment is designed to create an equitable work environment where all employees have equal opportunities.

However, the provided data does not specify any quantitative metrics regarding gender or minority representation within the company. While the company acknowledges the importance of diversity, it does not offer specific statistics or data points to illustrate the current state of diversity among its workforce. Instead, the focus appears to be on the processes and policies established to facilitate an inclusive workplace culture.

Moreover, ongoing training and awareness programs are part of the company's strategy to enhance understanding and implementation of DEI principles. Regular human rights-related education and training sessions are conducted to ensure that employees are well-informed of their rights and the importance of fostering an inclusive environment.

In summary, the company has a robust framework for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion through established policies and training initiatives. However, more specific data on workforce demographics would be beneficial to assess the effectiveness of these policies and provide a clearer picture of the company's commitment to DEI.","### **Evaluation of Policies and Initiatives for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in the CGPC ESG Report**

The ESG report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC) provides information on its policies and initiatives to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). The company highlights a structured approach to fostering employee development, gender diversity, and inclusive workplace practices. However, there is room for improvement in disclosing specific data on minority representation and broader diversity metrics.

---

### **Policies and Initiatives Supporting DEI**

1. **Gender Diversity:**
   - CGPC is actively pursuing gender diversity within its Board of Directors. In 2024, the addition of **Ms. Chen-Ming Chang** as an independent director marked a step toward gender diversity, supporting the company’s goal of ensuring diverse perspectives at the leadership level.
   - The company acknowledges the traditionally male-dominated nature of the petrochemical industry and aims to increase female representation in various roles.

2. **Training and Development:**
   - CGPC implements **diversity-focused training programs**, which include leadership development and skills enhancement initiatives for employees across all levels. In 2023, female employees participated in specific training sessions, slightly increasing their average training hours compared to their male counterparts.
   - Total training hours reached **21,666.5 hours** in 2023, with an average of **25.2 hours per employee**, demonstrating the company’s commitment to employee growth.

3. **Inclusive Policies:**
   - The company has established a **Sexual Harassment Complaint Handling Committee** and implemented a zero-tolerance policy for harassment. The mechanism ensures privacy and addresses incidents with corrective measures, including employee training on sexual harassment prevention.

---

### **Workforce Demographics**

1. **Gender Representation:**
   - CGPC’s workforce is predominantly male, reflecting the labor-intensive nature of its operations. In 2023, male employees comprised approximately **90%** of the total workforce, with females making up **10%**.
   - The company acknowledges the gender imbalance and has taken steps to attract more female talent, particularly in management and technical roles.

2. **Employment Type and Locations:**
   - Employees are distributed across Taipei, Toufen, and Kaohsiung, with efforts to recruit talent from diverse academic and professional backgrounds. In 2023, **57.2%** of employees held college degrees or higher.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
1. **Proactive Governance Initiatives:** The appointment of a female independent director aligns with CGPC’s commitment to board diversity.
2. **Employee Development Programs:** Extensive training opportunities and a focus on female participation highlight CGPC’s investment in workforce empowerment.
3. **Policies Against Workplace Harassment:** Clear mechanisms for addressing harassment demonstrate a commitment to creating a safe and inclusive environment.

**Areas for Improvement:**
1. **Expanded Diversity Metrics:** Providing data on minority representation or other dimensions of diversity beyond gender would enhance transparency.
2. **Gender Representation in Leadership:** While progress has been made, increasing female participation in senior management and technical roles remains an area for focus.
3. **Benchmarking and Goals:** Establishing measurable DEI targets and benchmarking against industry standards would provide stakeholders with a clearer understanding of CGPC’s progress.

---

### **Conclusion**

The CGPC ESG report reflects a genuine commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion through its governance initiatives, employee training programs, and anti-harassment policies. While the company has made strides in promoting gender diversity and fostering employee growth, further disclosure of broader diversity metrics and the establishment of specific DEI targets would strengthen its position as an inclusive employer. These enhancements would also better align CGPC with global best practices in diversity management.",0.375,0.0,0.8742334490361939,0.4583333333333333,0.55,0.6674247253669489

(3) To take care of the health of employees, additional cancer screening tests are provided every year for all employees: alpha-fetoglobulin (alpha-AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (colorectal cancer) CEA, prostate cancer (men), \n\novarian cancer (women), pancreatic cancer, and other 4 types of cancer. The examination expenses are entirely borne by the Company, and we provide comprehensive health care that exceeds the legal spirit. (4) In 2023, a total of 51 employees received health care services through the implementation of health care programs. Occupational medical specialists were commissioned to visit the company on a monthly basis to provide \n\nhealth services to employees, aiming to enhance their physical and mental well-being. (5) For the 2023 workplace health lectures, courses on the incidence of the top ten cancers, four types of cancer screening, women's cancers, and common women's diseases will be held to promote or prevent them. (6) In addition to labor insurance and national health insurance, CGPC purchases group accident insurance and group life insurance for each employee (the family members can also purchase additional insurance) to provide com-\n\nprehensive protection for the employees and their family members.

The report outlines that CGPC has established a robust framework for ethical operations, which includes a code of conduct applicable to employees, management, and directors, prohibiting unethical behaviors such as bribery, conflict of interest, and insider trading.

To promote compliance, CGPC has instituted an ""Audit Committee mailbox"" for whistleblowing cases related to unethical or illegal conduct. This mailbox is part of a broader set of measures approved by the board, which includes confidentiality protocols for whistleblowers and a clear process for handling reports. The report emphasizes that the company takes the confidentiality of whistleblowers seriously, ensuring that employees who report misconduct will not face retaliation. However, it is noted that the ""Audit Committee mailbox"" did not receive any whistleblowing or grievance cases in 2023, indicating either a lack of reported issues or effective compliance among employees.

The report further elaborates on the implementation of these policies through regular oversight. The head of Corporate Governance is responsible for providing annual reports on ethical management to the Board of Directors, ensuring that anti-corruption measures are monitored and assessed for effectiveness. This structured approach to governance, combined with regular training and education on ethical standards for employees, reinforces CGPC's commitment to maintaining a culture of integrity.

In summary, while the report outlines comprehensive anti-corruption policies and procedures, it lacks specific evidence of cases addressed or outcomes achieved in terms of addressing unethical behavior. Nonetheless, the absence of reported whistleblowing cases this year may suggest a positive compliance environment.","### **Evaluation of Anti-Corruption Policies and Procedures in CGPC**

The 2023 ESG report of China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC) outlines a robust framework for promoting ethical management and anti-corruption measures. These initiatives are embedded within its governance structure, policies, and operational practices.

---

### **Policies and Procedures**

1. **Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards:**
   - CGPC has implemented comprehensive ethical guidelines, including the **Ethical Management Best Practice Principles**, **Procedures for Ethical Management and Guidelines for Conduct**, and specific codes of conduct for directors, managers, and employees. These documents explicitly prohibit unethical behaviors, such as bribery, insider trading, and conflicts of interest.
   - Employees and stakeholders involved in business activities with CGPC are required to adhere to these principles, ensuring a standardized approach to ethical management.

2. **Whistleblowing Mechanisms:**
   - The company has established an “Audit Committee mailbox” on its website for reporting unethical or dishonest behaviors. The mechanism ensures confidentiality and protection for whistleblowers and includes provisions to prevent retaliation against employees who report misconduct.
   - Suggestions and grievances from external stakeholders can also be submitted through dedicated channels, demonstrating CGPC’s commitment to transparency and stakeholder engagement.

3. **Training and Awareness:**
   - In 2023, CGPC organized several seminars on ethics, including topics such as insider trading, information security, and workplace misconduct prevention. These seminars totaled **1,375 hours** and involved **1,968 participants**, reflecting the company’s proactive stance in fostering an ethical corporate culture.

---

### **Implementation and Outcomes**

1. **Internal Audits and Risk Assessments:**
   - CGPC conducts internal control evaluations to assess compliance with its ethical standards, including the identification of potential risks and self-supervision mechanisms. These evaluations ensure that ethical management practices are integrated into daily operations.

2. **No Reported Cases in 2023:**
   - According to the report, CGPC did not receive any whistleblowing or grievance cases through its reporting channels in 2023. While this could indicate effective implementation of ethical practices, it also highlights an opportunity to enhance employee and stakeholder confidence in utilizing these mechanisms.

---

### **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**

**Strengths:**
1. **Comprehensive Policies:** CGPC’s detailed guidelines and procedures provide a clear framework for preventing and addressing corruption.
2. **Employee Engagement:** The extensive training programs ensure that employees understand and comply with the company’s ethical standards.
3. **Transparency:** Publicly accessible whistleblowing mechanisms and reporting systems enhance accountability.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
1. **Utilization of Reporting Channels:** Encouraging greater use of whistleblowing systems could help uncover potential ethical issues.
2. **Performance Metrics:** Publishing quantitative outcomes, such as the number of audits conducted or cases resolved, could provide more evidence of effective implementation.

---

### **Conclusion**

CGPC’s anti-corruption framework is well-structured, encompassing clear policies, effective training, and transparent reporting mechanisms. These initiatives align with global best practices in ethical management. To further strengthen its anti-corruption efforts, the company could focus on increasing the visibility and utilization of its whistleblowing systems and providing more detailed evidence of implementation outcomes.",1.0,0.1333333332444444,0.563379442091423,0.6363636363636364,0.68,0.8710226547542423

Inherent Limitations \n\nThe  Subject  Matter  Information  involved  non-financial  information,  which  was  subject  to  more \ninherent limitations than financial information.""]","Yes, the report from China General Plastics Corporation (CGPC) has undergone a limited assurance engagement conducted by a third party. This verification process focused on selected performance indicators for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The verification process entails the third-party auditor planning and conducting a limited assurance engagement in accordance with established standards, including those set by the Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). The auditor's responsibilities include evaluating whether the Subject Matter Information is free from material misstatements due to fraud or error. This involves gathering evidence through inquiries with management and relevant personnel, as well as selecting sample items from the Subject Matter Information to perform various tests such as inspections, recalculations, and observations.

It is important to note that this limited assurance engagement provides a lower level of assurance compared to a reasonable assurance engagement. The inherent limitations of the engagement, particularly given that it involves non-financial information, mean that there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatements might remain undetected. The specific parts of the report that were validated are detailed in an appendix, although the exact indicators are not specified in the provided content.","### **Third-Party Verification and Assurance in CGPC's ESG Report**
